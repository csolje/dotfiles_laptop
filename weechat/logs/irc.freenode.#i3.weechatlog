2015-11-30 13:25:12	psyq	hey guys
2015-11-30 13:25:57	psyq	I am fairly new to i3 how do I change the resolution in i3?
2015-11-30 13:28:58	spill	ought to be possible through xrandr or arandr
2015-11-30 13:30:01	spill	yep, if you have arandr it's simple and then you can export it as a shellscript to apply the same changes via xrandr whenever you want
2015-11-30 13:30:34	spill	psyq: 
2015-11-30 13:31:12	psyq	spill: so I don't need to put the xrandr in the i3 conf file?
2015-11-30 13:31:52	spill	you can execute the command via i3 in any of many ways, I'd do an exec on a shellscript with the xrandr command
2015-11-30 13:33:01	psyq	cool thanks

2015-11-30 15:09:42	Zevv	Hi i3, this is probably a FAQ, but still:
2015-11-30 15:09:42	Zevv	I'm moving from xmonad to i3
2015-11-30 15:09:47	Zevv	normal reason: haskell configuration
2015-11-30 15:09:52	Zevv	I got my config mostly the way I want it
2015-11-30 15:10:16	Zevv	but the feature I miss the most is xmonads 'master' window
2015-11-30 15:10:26	Zevv	or master pane
2015-11-30 15:10:35	Zevv	$mod-Return in xmonad
2015-11-30 15:10:42	Zevv	is there an i3 equivalent for this
2015-11-30 15:11:35	Zevv	?
