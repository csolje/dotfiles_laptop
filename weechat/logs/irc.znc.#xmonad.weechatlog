2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[04:00:11] hi
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[04:01:26] I am having this issue "Not in scope: data constructor "Relative"" for when I use http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Actions-UpdatePointer.html in particular line 50 here: https://github.com/Newbrict/dots/blob/master/.xmonad/xmonad.hs is giving me issues... I have xmonad and xmonad-contrib installed on the machine though
2016-01-16 15:16:48	fizzie	[04:04:15] I think that particular bit got changed in XMonad 0.12.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[04:04:23] yes
2016-01-16 15:16:48	fizzie	[04:04:25] See https://wiki.haskell.org/Xmonad/Notable_changes_since_0.11#updatePointer
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[04:04:39] and the docs aon the website are still for 0.11 because nobody seems to know who has access to update it :/
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[04:05:05] and hackage isn't building docs :/
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[04:05:28] goddamn lol
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[04:06:14] (IIRC aavogt had to get help to update the website for 0.11. I should try digging throgh my old logs to see who was involved)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[04:06:50] alright thank you EVeRYONE that fixed it
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[04:07:06] you guys are the best
2016-01-16 15:16:48	⚡	geekosaur [04:17:26] reminded to add the getArgs things to that changes page
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[04:49:44] anyone here use two monitors with xmonad?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[04:58:17] yep
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Digit	[05:02:23] 3
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[05:03:27] is it nice? I'm about to set iti up
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:05:22] "nice" is a bit subjective...
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:06:18] for me it's nice enough that I ran out to get an additional monitor to hook to the work laptop so I could dual-screen xmonad on it (hadn't bothered with the original work-issued laptop which was OS X)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:07:04] (partly because multiscreen and virtual machines really don't mix, and since I do linux and solaris related support I almost always was in the VM)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:08:34] that said, I ... have perceptual and sensory differences, and things that work for me don't always work for other people
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:09:26] I will mention that many people dislike the default behavior with multiple monitors; see https://wiki.haskell.org/Xmonad/Frequently_asked_questions#Replacing_greedyView_with_view
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[05:09:29] vm doesn't work well with multi monitor?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:10:03] vbox and parallels both have very buggy multiscreen support, vmware doesn't even try any more
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[05:10:10] I must restart my computer is completely screwed
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[05:10:11] brb
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[05:11:22] I'm back
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:11:33] that is, when trying to expose multiple monitors to the guest OS. they run fine on a multiscreen system but only expose 1 monitor to the guest
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:12:58] vmware in fullscreen can expose both monitors but they look like one big monitor --- no xrandr/xinerama information
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[05:13:08] ah
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:13:49] vbox and parallels have severe drawing issues, and vbox can crash the host if you make it expose more than one monitor to the guest
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:16:45] (noneof this is related to xmonad though; just that moving to xmonad on a dedicated machine instead of os x or xmonad in a vm on os x meant I could duplicate an xmonad+multiscreen that works well for me)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:18:03] anyway, xmonad will use greedyView by default: if workspace 2 is on the secondary monitor and you press mod-2 while focused in the primary monitor, it will swap the workspaces so that the active workspace is always on the primary monitor.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:18:43] this is because you can't tell which monitor has focus if both are empty or you suppress borders in either workspace
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:19:51] if you do something that will show you the monitor focus (e.g. https://github.com/geekosaur/xmonad.hs/blob/pyanfar/xmonad.hs#L268) then you can switch to using view instead of greedyView, so workspaces don't get swapped between monitors
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[05:20:51] (this behavior is also why smartBorders from XMonad.Layout.NoBorders will refuse to do anything in a multiscreen config. if you provide some other way to identify which monitor has focus then you can use lessBorders otherIndicated
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[05:20:51] that sounds very nice
2016-01-16 15:16:48	oldbrict	[06:16:57] omfg getting solarized colors to work with urxvt/vim is so annoying
2016-01-16 15:16:48	⚡	geekosaur [06:43:02] PRs a proper ungrab
2016-01-16 15:16:48	⚡	geekosaur [07:16:03] wonders if it would be easier to rewrite Cheibriados's git functionality in Haskell, or teach Cheibriados to use mueval >.>
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[07:16:33] (Chei = DCSS devs' irc git bot)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[07:20:22] guess that answers that question. chei's source is apparently not available
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[07:22:12] oh, there it is.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[07:22:33] not an ungodly hybrid of perl and ruby like sequell is. suppose I could hold my nose >.>
2016-01-16 15:16:48	geekosaur	[07:24:15] (also I probably can't usefully haskell on my bouncer host, sigh)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	johnsonSteward	[09:37:05] is the weather location of xmobar encoded using ICAO?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	johnsonSteward	[09:40:09] i mean, if i dont live in the States, how can i get my weather with this code (seems it only has places inside the states)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	fizzie	[10:07:32] Huh? There are ICAO codes for pretty much every airport everywhere.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	fizzie	[10:08:19] (Which is indeed what it seems to be -- it gets the data from http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/observations/metar/decoded/ABCD.TXT, where ABCD is the station ID you specify.)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	johnsonSteward	[10:13:34] fizzie: my fault.. didn't notice
