2015-11-08 15:55:24	Psyq	which destro gives you the most power over your system
2015-11-08 15:56:12	JayVii	probably something that comes somewhat barebone
2015-11-08 15:56:23	+MatthewAllan93	probably gentoo
2015-11-08 15:56:27	JayVii	so you can build it from the essentials up to something you want
2015-11-08 15:56:37	JayVii	yeah, gentoo would be a nice example
2015-11-08 15:56:58	JayVii	gentoo gives you even more control than any binary-based distro could
2015-11-08 15:57:20	Psyq	okie
2015-11-08 15:57:25	Psyq	what about Arch
2015-11-08 15:58:32	JayVii	surely, arch as well. debian-netinstall (or almost any netinstall, in that regard)
2015-11-08 15:58:43	JayVii	but not to such a degree as gentoo
2015-11-08 16:01:26	+Acou_Bass	JayVii: yeah i did try another profile last week, but im gonna try that again :P
2015-11-08 16:04:14	Psyq	I have heard that debian is not that in control of ur system as Arch and Gentoo
2015-11-08 16:05:02	+Acou_Bass	technically youre right... but really linux is linux, if you REALLY want to 'control' a debian install you can do 
2015-11-08 16:05:10	+Acou_Bass	the difference is arch/gentoo give you the tools OOTB to do so
2015-11-08 16:06:07	Psyq	okie
2015-11-08 16:06:11	+Acou_Bass	eg. gentoos package manager which lets you compile stuff insanely granularly, or arch's minimal dependencies that let you only install exactly what you want
2015-11-08 16:06:46	Psyq	so starting with Arch and then more over to Gentoo on a later date
2015-11-08 16:07:17	+Acou_Bass	if you wanna sure XD i personally moved to arch and stuck to it because it does everything i want
2015-11-08 16:07:36	Psyq	cool
2015-11-08 16:10:20	JayVii	triued gentoo once in a vbox, but didn't really feel like so much control is necessary. especially because it outweighs the gain (gain/cost ratio is not high enough for me *PERSONALLY*)
2015-11-08 16:10:31	JayVii	stuck to debian & voidlinux, myself
2015-11-08 16:11:08	JayVii	but it's a subjective decision and everyone needs to try it for oneself
2015-11-08 16:13:43	Psyq	I tried debian and I had a lot of problems with the hardware

2015-11-08 16:15:56	@Irishluc1	hi
2015-11-08 16:16:25	+Acou_Bass	well JayVii arch doesnt have much OOTb so i think the very little you do get is mostly FOSS, but it uses a really big kernel with as much hardware support as possible in it (whether or not those blobs are free) XD
2015-11-08 16:16:30	+Acou_Bass	whereas debian i think uses a libre kernel
2015-11-08 16:16:42	+shymega	there's parabola which is based on arch
2015-11-08 16:17:04	+shymega	i think it's called parabola, it's like a libre version, so without broadcom drivers ;)
2015-11-08 16:17:14	+MatthewAllan93	yes it is called that shymega :)
2015-11-08 16:17:21	+Acou_Bass	yeah parabola repos are all free, its cool
2015-11-08 16:17:34	+Acou_Bass	because regular arch repos DO have some non-free stuff like skype in them
2015-11-08 16:17:37	JayVii	ah, right
2015-11-08 16:17:42	+MatthewAllan93	i like that also :)

2015-11-08 16:18:55	+shymega	like ubuntu and the multiverse repo
2015-11-08 16:19:20	+shymega	although, ubuntu probably isn't going to be approved, what with the amazon reporting
2015-11-08 16:19:26	+MatthewAllan93	i know what you mean :), in void they have a seperate repo for nonfree :)

2015-11-08 18:44:54	Psyq	hey msjche 
2015-11-08 18:45:11	msjche	heya Psyq how you doin?
2015-11-08 18:45:32	Psyq	great thank you for your great videos :)
2015-11-08 18:45:37	JayVii	haha, funny story. i was out with friends last night. and we stood in front of a pub, waiting for one of my friends. some guy approached us, with an un-lit cig in his mouth (i assumed he would ask for a lighter). Well, he came up to us and asked "Does anyone of you guys smoke?" One of my friends: "Yup." Guy: "cool, what stuff do you smoke then?" and nope, he didn't meant the cig-brand :D
2015-11-08 18:45:58	msjche	thanks ! glad you like them :)
2015-11-08 18:46:22	Psyq	JayVii: hehehe 
2015-11-08 18:46:34	msjche	welp, i just got beat up by gentoo (more accurately xorg) on my laptop :'(
2015-11-08 18:46:35	Santo_101	hehe, yeah shit happens JayVii 
2015-11-08 18:46:44	JayVii	Psyq: i haven't messed with it much, as Fedora is one of those distros that you install and are good to go immediately (kinda like OpenSUSE, LinuxMint or Ubuntu). And while that may be good for some people, it's not really appeailing to me
2015-11-08 18:46:54	Santo_101	but that doesnt beat what happened to me and the misses
2015-11-08 18:47:35	JayVii	spit it out, then :D
2015-11-08 18:47:38	Psyq	msjche: you are not running Arch on your laptop anymore?
2015-11-08 18:48:06	Santo_101	we were walking through the city and naturally passed the police station, with the margin of five metres or so, when some guys shouted from the car, "wanna buy some shit?"
2015-11-08 18:48:08	msjche	tried to install gentoo again and miserably failed to get xdm and bumblebee to work
2015-11-08 18:48:54	Psyq	and did you get it to work?
2015-11-08 18:49:56	JayVii	Santo_101: LOL!
2015-11-08 18:50:13	JayVii	happened to use in Amsterdam, but surely not in front of a police station :D
2015-11-08 18:50:29	Santo_101	yeah, cops and shit sitting there at night and all :P
2015-11-08 18:50:43	JayVii	:D
2015-11-08 18:50:46	msjche	Psyq: nope, tried all available versions of xorg-drivers, nvidia-drivers, custom xorg.conf.  everything i could think of.  reloaded a clonezilla of arch
2015-11-08 18:51:17	msjche	do not try to install gentoo on an nvidia optimus laptop
2015-11-08 18:51:36	Psyq	okie it is your XPS?
2015-11-08 18:51:40	 *	Santo_101 claims challenge is accepted
2015-11-08 18:51:51	msjche	yeah
2015-11-08 18:52:11	JayVii	:D
2015-11-08 18:53:08	Santo_101	but i will probably have to look into clonezilla though
2015-11-08 18:53:19	Psyq	I thought that the XPS was compatible with Gentoo
2015-11-08 18:54:14	msjche	the problem is with the optimus intel + nvidia graphics card.  you need bumblebee to switch between graphics cards.
2015-11-08 18:54:42	JayVii	hurray for CLI-apps :D https://i.imgur.com/qNwOzUd.png
2015-11-08 18:54:43	Psyq	okie so it is a headache
2015-11-08 18:54:53	msjche	scoured the googs as well.  noone seems to know any solutions
2015-11-08 18:54:59	JayVii	i just notice, my mpd-thing in conky doesn't work

2015-11-08 20:39:01	youngbak1	oooh dose it support vimperator 
2015-11-08 20:39:07	youngbak1	and lightweight
2015-11-08 20:40:51	+rypervenche	It's not anymore lightweight really. They just get rid of stuff that isn't super libre.
2015-11-08 20:41:14	+rypervenche	Well, I suppose it could be. But it depends on your distro I guess. I can choose to not compile most of those things into mine.
2015-11-08 20:42:42	+Acou_Bass	i think icecat would be slightly more lightweight because it does strip a fair few features out (like pocket/hello etc) XD
2015-11-08 20:42:58	+Acou_Bass	but not enough to make a real difference probably
2015-11-08 20:43:06	+Acou_Bass	its focus is freedom not lightweightness hehe
2015-11-08 20:44:58	youngbak1	Acou_Bass: so which one is more lightweight apart from w3m,lynx i mean gui 
2015-11-08 20:46:05	+Acou_Bass	errrm probably qutebrowser hehe or midori
2015-11-08 20:46:23	+MatthewAllan93	you could try vimb
2015-11-08 20:46:28	+Acou_Bass	qutebrowser is insanely minimal on the GUI though, so if you want clicky buttons go for midori
2015-11-08 20:49:24	youngbak1	does it also support vim key biddings like for vimperator
2015-11-08 20:49:37	youngbak1	i hate clicking and mouse :)
2015-11-08 20:49:37	+MatthewAllan93	which one youngbak1?
2015-11-08 20:50:30	+Acou_Bass	yeah qutebrowser is like using vimperator hehe
2015-11-08 20:50:33	+Acou_Bass	(so is vimb)
2015-11-08 20:51:10	+MatthewAllan93	haha yes it is :)
2015-11-08 20:51:55	youngbak1	hahha thanks for those tips lool
2015-11-08 20:52:07	youngbak1	downloading now .....
2015-11-08 20:52:19	+MatthewAllan93	also vimb is gtk based and qutebrowser is qt based
2015-11-08 20:52:23	+MatthewAllan93	just to let you know :)
2015-11-08 20:52:54	youngbak1	mmh am gtk fun 
2015-11-08 20:53:16	+Acou_Bass	yeah, the main isue with gtk-webkit browsers for me is they screw up when you use a dark gtk theme whereas qt-webkit oens dont hehe

2015-11-08 21:00:28	youngbak1	ok 
2015-11-08 21:00:53	youngbak1	MatthewAllan93: vimb supports firefox addons ?
2015-11-08 21:01:05	JayVii	see, if there is a package "ncurses-devel"
2015-11-08 21:01:09	+MatthewAllan93	no i don't think so
2015-11-08 21:01:21	JayVii	nope, vimb is a webkit browser
2015-11-08 21:01:24	JayVii	no firefox addons
2015-11-08 21:01:41	+MatthewAllan93	JayVii: what was the command for cava with ncmcpp? :)
2015-11-08 21:01:54	JayVii	you mean with mpd?
2015-11-08 21:02:02	+MatthewAllan93	yes sorry
2015-11-08 21:02:30	JayVii	i use "cava -f 30 -c green -m normal -s 150% -i fifo -p /tmp/mpd.fifo"
2015-11-08 21:02:39	JayVii	but you can play around with the settings
2015-11-08 21:02:57	JayVii	also you need to set up your mpd to put the fifo-output to that location
2015-11-08 21:03:09	+MatthewAllan93	ok thanks JayVii :), i have done :)
2015-11-08 21:03:16	JayVii	ok
2015-11-08 21:03:18	+MatthewAllan93	thanks for letting me know though :)
2015-11-08 21:03:45	JayVii	the essential part of the command would be "cava -i fifo -p /tmp/mpd.fifo"
2015-11-08 21:04:16	+MatthewAllan93	ok :)

2015-11-08 23:00:52	+Acou_Bass	some crappy fujitsu i got off y mum when she got a new one
2015-11-08 23:01:20	+shymega	oh, right
2015-11-08 23:01:51	+Acou_Bass	its not by any means a good laptop nor is it one i would choose to own - i just couldnt bear to see hardware be thrown away so ive kept it :P
2015-11-08 23:02:11	+shymega	i'm like that too
2015-11-08 23:02:25	+shymega	it would explain the 6 laptops i keep
2015-11-08 23:02:49	+Acou_Bass	XD
2015-11-08 23:02:59	+Acou_Bass	im sort of looking forward to my mum getting a new laptop now
2015-11-08 23:03:03	+Acou_Bass	the one she has is pretty swish
2015-11-08 23:03:20	+shymega	i hate it when family members get new tech
2015-11-08 23:03:24	+Acou_Bass	its like, almost-netbook sized, with a nice touchscreen on it
2015-11-08 23:03:26	+shymega	because it means i will have to fix it
2015-11-08 23:03:34	+Acou_Bass	would run arch/gnome soo well
2015-11-08 23:03:53	+Acou_Bass	xD
2015-11-08 23:03:53	+shymega	and by fix it i don't mean install linux
2015-11-08 23:04:14	+Acou_Bass	i booted ubuntu on that touchscreen laptop once... just to show her what shes missing
2015-11-08 23:04:18	+shymega	i mean drain tea out of the damn keyboard for one
2015-11-08 23:04:21	+Acou_Bass	she said its nice but muhh utunez
2015-11-08 23:04:23	+Acou_Bass	:(
2015-11-08 23:04:33	+shymega	utenez is a weird way of saying windoze

2015-11-08 23:04:43	+shymega	:P
2015-11-08 23:04:47	+Acou_Bass	she has iThings unfortunately
2015-11-08 23:05:17	+shymega	there's no chance now
2015-11-08 23:05:32	+shymega	windows, i{phone,pad,blah,watch,toilet,dvd}
2015-11-08 23:05:52	+Acou_Bass	nah, she only has an ipod now i think... she ditched her iphone for an android of some sort
2015-11-08 23:06:06	+Acou_Bass	but she still uses te ipod alot and its one of the newer ones that dont work on linux
2015-11-08 23:06:08	+Acou_Bass	XD
2015-11-08 23:06:32	+shymega	it _had_ to be, eh?
2015-11-08 23:06:38	+shymega	it's always sods' law
2015-11-08 23:06:39	+Acou_Bass	yee
2015-11-08 23:07:47	+Acou_Bass	oh and the other problem was
2015-11-08 23:07:52	+Acou_Bass	ubuntus touchscreen support is diabolical
2015-11-08 23:07:55	+Acou_Bass	xd
2015-11-08 23:09:03	+Acou_Bass	for example: open up the main menu thingy (as in, click ubuntu icon)... swipe your finger up the screen
2015-11-08 23:09:08	+Acou_Bass	what do you expect to happen/
2015-11-08 23:09:22	+shymega	idk, i haven't used ubuntu in ages
2015-11-08 23:09:28	+shymega	clippy?
2015-11-08 23:09:28	+Acou_Bass	well
2015-11-08 23:09:36	+Acou_Bass	what happens when you do the samething on your phone?

2015-11-08 23:10:02	+shymega	menu of apps, and widgets
2015-11-08 23:10:12	+Acou_Bass	usually what happens is, the app menu *scrolls up and down as you stroke it up and down*
2015-11-08 23:10:14	+Acou_Bass	right?
2015-11-08 23:10:16	+Acou_Bass	XD
2015-11-08 23:10:26	+shymega	oh right
2015-11-08 23:10:37	+Acou_Bass	not on ubuntu, hell no
2015-11-08 23:10:44	+Acou_Bass	what happens is, it thinks youre left click-dragging
2015-11-08 23:10:53	+Acou_Bass	so it grabs an icon and starts mving it arond the screen
2015-11-08 23:11:07	+shymega	xD
2015-11-08 23:11:23	+shymega	and messes up the perfect way icons were organised
2015-11-08 23:11:38	+shymega	well done Ubuntu touchscreens _slow clap_
2015-11-08 23:11:50	+shymega	oh good, my slow clap processor made it into this thing. So we have that.
2015-11-08 23:11:51	+Acou_Bass	i might try gnome on it and see how that goes
2015-11-08 23:11:54	+Acou_Bass	XD
2015-11-08 23:12:25	+Acou_Bass	firefox has the same issue (not ubuntus fault, this is 100% on mozilla)
2015-11-08 23:12:32	+Acou_Bass	you stroke your finger up the screen expecting the web page to scroll
2015-11-08 23:12:39	+Acou_Bass	and what actually happens is it highlights all your text
2015-11-08 23:12:41	+Acou_Bass	xd
2015-11-08 23:12:56	+shymega	how about XFCE? the menu kinda likes look windows (to me at least)
2015-11-08 23:13:00	+shymega	what
2015-11-08 23:13:40	+Acou_Bass	i cant imagine xfce having good touchscreen support, but y'know thats not what xfce is for hehe
2015-11-08 23:13:45	+shymega	how on earth is that scrolling, that's pressing V in vimpertator and then dragging with the touchscreen
2015-11-08 23:13:57	+shymega	yeah, this vm might need a reboot
2015-11-08 23:14:11	+Acou_Bass	like i said, i think linux just has trouble diffrentiating between touchscreens and left click/dragging
2015-11-08 23:14:14	+Acou_Bass	XD
2015-11-08 23:14:33	+shymega	it's been on for 17 days now, and it's become a challenge XD
2015-11-08 23:14:47	+Acou_Bass	i hope to be proven wrong if i try gnome instead of unity though :D
2015-11-08 23:14:50	+Acou_Bass	and XD fun
2015-11-08 23:15:09	+shymega	yeah, so much for linux the new desktop, considering that many laptops have touchscreens, and people actually use them
2015-11-08 23:15:18	+Acou_Bass	yee
2015-11-08 23:15:25	+Acou_Bass	honestly sitting watching my mum use her laptop
2015-11-08 23:15:30	+Acou_Bass	its amazing how much she uses thta touchscreen
2015-11-08 23:15:36	+Acou_Bass	and us nerds sit here and call it gimmicky nonsense
2015-11-08 23:15:39	+Acou_Bass	she uses it *constantly* XD
2015-11-08 23:16:41	@Irishluck83	msjche: can see your battery-level-polling.conf see how you got 4 more hours
2015-11-08 23:17:00	+Acou_Bass	in that form-factor (ie. miniature laptop-size) i think it makes sense, your fingers even when theyre on the keyboard theyre barely an inch away from the screen, can just poke a finger up and boom, button pressed ;P

2015-11-09 00:00:49	+shymega	Acou_Bass: also if you have a spare vt console, try running emacs with --debug-init, see if any LISP errors arise
2015-11-09 00:01:14	+shymega	another thing, do you get a message in the minibuffer about XELP and no protocol specified or supported
2015-11-09 00:01:52	+shymega	if so, i had that, installing xhost _seemed_ to fix it
2015-11-09 00:01:55	+Acou_Bass	shymega: just the one screen :P
2015-11-09 00:01:59	+Acou_Bass	and ill try xhost

2015-11-09 00:02:21	+shymega	oh right, xrandr shouldn't have many issues then, could be a LISP error or xhost
2015-11-09 00:02:27	+shymega	or something else

2015-11-09 00:46:19	+alexandros_c	so what distro are you going to put on it?
2015-11-09 00:47:11	+alexandros_c	that seems better than my intel nuc i5
2015-11-09 00:47:20	JayVii	i'll use it as my print-/file-/mediaserver
2015-11-09 00:47:40	JayVii	probably debian. setting up & forget :D
2015-11-09 00:47:54	JayVii	cronjob for updates every 2 weeks

2015-11-09 00:48:06	+alexandros_c	nice
2015-11-09 00:48:28	JayVii	might even see, if it can handle 2D-platformer games (like supermeatboy and the like)
2015-11-09 00:48:48	JayVii	if so, i'll buy a controller and make myself a retro-console. 
2015-11-09 00:48:57	JayVii	I highly doubt that thing is strong enough, though
2015-11-09 00:49:18	JayVii	so yeah. file-server is the main purpose
2015-11-09 00:49:25	+alexandros_c	so how much you ram comes with the system?
2015-11-09 00:49:31	JayVii	and print-server just for convinience
2015-11-09 00:49:41	JayVii	2GB
2015-11-09 00:50:01	+alexandros_c	how about using openmediavault, it is based on debian.

2015-11-09 00:50:32	JayVii	half of that project is fun :D

2015-11-09 00:51:03	JayVii	nothing fancy
2015-11-09 00:51:17	JayVii	less power than modern mobile CPU's
2015-11-09 00:51:36	JayVii	but i needed it to be a x86 architecture, not ARM

2015-11-09 01:27:26	@pdq	lol
2015-11-09 01:29:53	JayVii	you know, since i want to stream videos & stuff with the mini-server, it cannot be headless. what do you guys think is the desktop with the smallest footprint? or should i just go with the Xsession
2015-11-09 01:30:19	JayVii	some tiling WM withought any bars or borders could also work, eh?
2015-11-09 01:30:29	@pdq	jwm is lightest and best is why i use it :P
2015-11-09 01:30:57	mkay_	why can't it be headless? 
2015-11-09 01:31:27	JayVii	mkay_: because there needs to be a Xsession for video to be displayed
2015-11-09 01:31:31	JayVii	:D
2015-11-09 01:31:54	mkay_	if the stuff just needs X there is no need to install a desktop environment though, (or even a simple window-manager actually)
2015-11-09 01:32:00	@pdq	ah i thought you were going to host and serve video from that to your desktops/;laptops
2015-11-09 01:32:17	JayVii	no, i just want to display video on that thing
2015-11-09 01:32:24	JayVii	it will be hooked up with my TV
2015-11-09 01:32:56	JayVii	so, mpv, and *maybe* a webbrowser, if it decide to get a neflix account
2015-11-09 01:33:01	JayVii	i*
2015-11-09 01:33:15	@pdq	nice
2015-11-09 01:33:32	mkay_	a "windowmanager" that always shows all windows fullsrcreen would be perfect for a tv
2015-11-09 01:33:34	JayVii	everything else is CLI
2015-11-09 01:33:42	JayVii	so, any tiling wm :D
2015-11-09 01:33:50	mkay_	mm....
2015-11-09 01:34:00	@pdq	why tiling
2015-11-09 01:34:07	@pdq	jwm is super light and has a panel and systray and menu if you want to use those things and uses a simple configgg
2015-11-09 01:34:14	JayVii	because all tiling WM's have a full-screen mode
2015-11-09 01:34:14	mkay_	how do tiling windowmanager handle dialogboxes btw? 
2015-11-09 01:34:18	@pdq	much lighter than a tiling wm
2015-11-09 01:34:25	JayVii	i don't need any panel
2015-11-09 01:34:30	JayVii	really?
2015-11-09 01:34:36	@pdq	then you not need to include it in config 
2015-11-09 01:34:38	JayVii	well, i might do that, then pdq
2015-11-09 01:35:12	JayVii	first i have to see, if linux boots on there
2015-11-09 01:35:21	JayVii	that thing comes with win8.1
2015-11-09 01:35:24	JayVii	or win10
2015-11-09 01:35:26	JayVii	cannot remember
2015-11-09 01:35:31	@pdq	i didn't read up, it already arrived?
2015-11-09 01:35:40	mkay_	systray can be usefull for changing sound volume
2015-11-09 01:36:25	mkay_	unless you have a keyboard with sound-keys at the tv too
2015-11-09 01:36:30	@pdq	myself i don't use a systray but it can be yep
2015-11-09 01:36:50	JayVii	pdq, no it will arrive on tue or wed
2015-11-09 01:36:58	@pdq	aha coolio
2015-11-09 01:37:33	JayVii	mkay_: in fluxbox i have hotkeys for: "amixer sset Master 2db+" and "amixer sset Master 2db-"
2015-11-09 01:37:42	JayVii	conky shows me the current level
2015-11-09 01:39:01	JayVii	looks like this https://i.imgur.com/JCdfWTs.png (there is "Volume" somewhere on the top-panel
2015-11-09 01:39:20	mkay_	my tv setup only have a mouse in that room, it could be interesting to have something like "when mouse is at top right corner the mouse wheel is volumne control" or something like that. is that easy to do?
2015-11-09 01:39:59	JayVii	mkay_: euh, idk... kwin can do that
2015-11-09 01:40:14	JayVii	i may use kdeconnect & my smartphone as a remote
2015-11-09 01:40:23	JayVii	can also change volume & stuff

2015-11-09 01:42:25	JayVii	it's funny... the thing that lead me to my final decision was, that i don't want to dualboot, just for my printer-drivers (brother only offers them as .deb and .rpm and repackaging is a true nightmare).

2015-11-09 01:51:14	mkay_	For my TV use, can Nvidia drivers handle so - when the TV goes on (=someone switches to show HDMI there), it replaces one of my screens? (and also let the tv have 60Hz that it can do without me having to turn off the interlace mode it seems to love in the settings each time)
2015-11-09 01:52:20	mkay_	it is a bit bothersome to have to start Nvidias settings program each time I want to let the picture go to the tv.

2015-11-09 01:57:05	JayVii	mkay_: sometimes, your Xorg.conf contains only a certain range
2015-11-09 01:57:19	JayVii	AMD's catalyst-drivers do that quite often
2015-11-09 01:57:35	mkay_	until now I have to, first start Nvidia Settings, click advanced so I can change to 60 Hz (2) that is othwerise not visible (it is the noninterlace mode), then exit Nvidia Settings and start it again so I can uncheck the graphic card scaling checkbox (that is otherwise not visible) for the TV, move it to be same part of desktop. Then if I look at some film from webbrowser make sure the fullscreen-button is outside my monitors
2015-11-09 01:57:35	mkay_	 4:3 area and only on the TV's 16:9 area for it to fullscreen to 16:9 TV right....
2015-11-09 01:58:13	JayVii	they limited my maximum screen-resolution to 3000x1080. Since i have a 1680x1050 screen, i couldn't have my 1920x1080 TV next to it
2015-11-09 01:58:24	JayVii	had to manually edit that
2015-11-09 01:58:51	mkay_	strange
2015-11-09 01:59:55	mkay_	my monitor is 1600x1200 and the tv is 1080P
2015-11-09 02:00:16	mkay_	that is the TV do 1920x1080@up to 60Hz
2015-11-09 02:03:23	mkay_	the monitor displays a 75Hz, I wonder what it do when displaying the same picture to both?
2015-11-09 02:03:52	mkay_	and the film itself is perhaps 48 frames/second or something I guess
2015-11-09 02:04:27	@pdq	24 maybe, not many above that
2015-11-09 02:05:26	mkay_	ah yeah
2015-11-09 02:05:27	@pdq	75 is nice, you must be able to tell when moving mouse/windows from one to the other?
2015-11-09 02:05:41	@pdq	i notice a huge diff here but have 144 hz and 60's
2015-11-09 02:06:36	mkay_	I suppose the normal speed for a (CRT) monitor is 85Hz but my quite old screen can't do more than 75Hz in 1600x1200
2015-11-09 02:06:43	@pdq	i noticed my older 1440*900 can also set it to 75 hz with nvidia settings, when i used it as main years ago i had no idea it could be overclocked
2015-11-09 02:07:00	@pdq	ahh its a crt too?
2015-11-09 02:07:51	mkay_	ah yeah, my screens are CRT (both almost same, but one of them is trinitron), while the TV is a new flatscreen LED lighted thing
2015-11-09 02:08:15	@pdq	cool
2015-11-09 02:10:14	mkay_	I hope they don't break.... I guess a new 1600x1200 TFT screen can be quite expensive with everyone only doing 1080 :-/
2015-11-09 02:11:08	mkay_	I suppose I whould try to find a "16:10" tft-screen?  1920x1200
2015-11-09 02:12:07	@pdq	what is tft?
2015-11-09 02:12:52	mkay_	tft uh.... is well what is called... a thin screen.  a non-crt
2015-11-09 02:13:21	@pdq	well crt are no longer manufactured so all displays are non crt? hehe
2015-11-09 02:13:32	mkay_	I suppose :-D
2015-11-09 02:14:27	@pdq	i never used one myself i heard they were really good for counter strike/quake etc and only drawback was could get headaches or eyes sore cause of how they work
2015-11-09 02:17:28	mkay_	back to film viewing from the computer onto the tv, I suppose it would be nice if the film-viewing thing inside the web browser, and vlc, could tell the nvidia-driver to switch to 50Hz if the thing I look at is 50Hz/25Hz like (PAL) tv programs are
2015-11-09 02:17:59	mkay_	pdq: if try to run a CRT at 60Hz or lower you will get headaches yes :-D
2015-11-09 02:18:41	mkay_	bleeding eyes
2015-11-09 02:19:53	@pdq	ah
2015-11-09 02:20:31	mkay_	I was quite confused when the first non-crt screens came and they did only 60Hz. "whut!??!!" (and their displays what actually quite a lot slower than that too)
2015-11-09 02:21:19	@pdq	yeah, but most video is at max 30, there is some 60 fps stuff recently and the lotr hobbit was 48 fps i think?
2015-11-09 02:21:35	@pdq	but is so nice having desktop at high refresh rate, so smooth
2015-11-09 02:22:01	@pdq	120 would be nice at 1080
2015-11-09 02:22:27	@pdq	i woudl rather have 120hz 1080p then 60hz 4k :P
2015-11-09 02:23:09	mkay_	ah yeah. I read that the problem with Hobbit's 48 frame/s is that everything looks real. and it they cheated during filming (like just painting something to look like stone) it is visible. so filming gets more expensive....
2015-11-09 02:23:38	@pdq	ah
2015-11-09 02:25:31	mkay_	and stuff like "some hobbits walking in the mountains" with normal film looks ok, but with 48fps it looks like "people dressed as hobbits walking..." X-D
2015-11-09 02:25:48	@pdq	lol
2015-11-09 02:26:31	@pdq	that is his fault though i'm sure if he did another like it now they know of and could fix all the things that appeared broken in hindight and with advances in technology and their experience
2015-11-09 02:27:15	@pdq	120 fps is nice but is not much source material for it unless count peoples digital videos they make
2015-11-09 02:27:49	@pdq	some people upload 120 fps slowed down half speed onto youtube and can awatch it with 2 x speed
2015-11-09 02:27:55	@pdq	240 fps*
2015-11-09 02:28:50	mkay_	hehehe
2015-11-09 02:29:09	@pdq	games and apps lookl great though, video less so unless is slow mo or somethign where can appreciate it
2015-11-09 02:29:20	mkay_	I would like a control in youtube to be able to slow down films like I can do with VLC....
2015-11-09 02:29:25	@pdq	i should check out that hobbit movie someday

2015-11-13 21:30:45	+MatthewAllan93	oh good :)
2015-11-13 21:30:56	+shymega	which is rather difficult, docs not so much, but downloading packages _required_ to start emacs
2015-11-13 21:31:11	+shymega	yeah, i'm nearly finished my data limit :
2015-11-13 21:31:24	+MatthewAllan93	i know what you mean
2015-11-13 21:31:55	+MatthewAllan93	going to try and have a go of emacs tomorrow :)
2015-11-13 21:32:37	+shymega	lisp though, is just adorable haha, like I'm studying fs maths && english now, i left my old college, and my teacher won't let me use polish notations for mathematics
2015-11-13 21:32:45	+shymega	it's not on the syllabus
2015-11-13 21:32:53	+shymega	no, it's not but it looks pretty
2015-11-13 21:33:05	+shymega	cool, from scratch or like a distro thing?
2015-11-13 21:34:13	+MatthewAllan93	oh :(, going to a new college then? looking at config and see how it can fit me :) and then just see how i can get you use to it because when i have a go of it now i can't get use to it haha
2015-11-13 21:34:23	+MatthewAllan93	*looking at your config
2015-11-13 21:47:05	+shymega	yeah, my config isn't up to date

2015-11-13 21:47:38	+shymega	that way it's not seperate
2015-11-13 21:48:32	+shymega	a lot of people say that the config and key bindings for emacs are hard to learn, they are not that hard, and if you're unsure and things might go bad, C-g
2015-11-13 21:49:33	+shymega	nah, can't get into any others now, so I'm going to a flexible educational provider, and they can teach me maths and english, then i'll go to a new college sept, get GCSE English and Maths, and then study CompSci the next year
2015-11-13 21:49:46	+shymega	aim is to study AI at Uni after all this polova

2015-11-13 23:53:01	mkay_	heavy enough
2015-11-13 23:53:10	c_smith	isn't Howard the one who they had when they did Holy Diver?
2015-11-13 23:53:21	c_smith	or was that Jesse?
2015-11-13 23:53:36	+Piece_Maker	yeah, jesse was first singer, then howard came in, he was the big bald black dude, then they got jesse back
2015-11-13 23:54:23	+Piece_Maker	new jesse sounds slightly better than old jesse because hes actually fucking learnt to sing
2015-11-13 23:54:27	+Piece_Maker	but i still prefer howard
2015-11-13 23:54:29	+Piece_Maker	XD
2015-11-13 23:54:44	c_smith	ah, so Howard was with them in the stuff like Holy Diver and The End Of Heartache
2015-11-13 23:55:13	c_smith	though tbh my top 2 bands are Disturbed and A7X,
2015-11-13 23:55:35	+Piece_Maker	yarr
2015-11-13 23:56:08	+Piece_Maker	i love that holy diver cover
2015-11-13 23:56:34	c_smith	Piece_Maker: they did that cover well, imo
2015-11-13 23:56:54	c_smith	anyone here like stuff like 3 Doors Down?
2015-11-13 23:57:15	+Piece_Maker	the mark of a good cover for me is when it sounds like the covering band wrote it, IE. it is absolutely 'their style' and not the original style at al
2015-11-13 23:57:17	+Piece_Maker	XD
2015-11-13 23:57:21	+Piece_Maker	never heard of 3 doors down hehe

2015-11-14 13:27:00	 *	Santo_101 is somewhat confused
2015-11-14 13:31:12	JayVii	why's that?
2015-11-14 13:33:11	Santo_101	It almost seemed as you were tense the other day. pissed off at the computer??
2015-11-14 13:35:21	JayVii	quite a bit, yeah
2015-11-14 13:35:59	Santo_101	kinda figured i caught ya in bad timing
2015-11-14 13:37:25	Santo_101	have you returned it then??
2015-11-14 13:40:32	JayVii	Santo_101: i wrote them. will sent it back on monday
2015-11-14 13:40:51	JayVii	had to install a .deb or .rpm distro on my main-rig now instead
2015-11-14 13:40:55	JayVii	i went with debian
2015-11-14 13:40:57	JayVii	http://i.imgur.com/M4ANNd8.png
2015-11-14 13:41:06	JayVii	Debian Sid (unstable) for that matter :P
2015-11-14 13:41:14	JayVii	rolling, rolling, rolling :D
2015-11-14 13:41:44	JayVii	using debian-stable's kernel, though. because amd-drivers and kernel 4.2 = no-good
2015-11-14 13:41:44	Santo_101	rolling in the deep :P
2015-11-14 13:42:45	Santo_101	btw dont see what you complain about amd and kernel 4.2

2015-11-14 13:43:26	JayVii	there is a patch for that, which most distributions applied, that use kernel 4.2 by default (eg: arch and voidlinux)
2015-11-14 13:43:42	JayVii	but debian's 4.2 kernel is for the unstable & testing branches
2015-11-14 13:43:46	JayVii	so they give a shit :D
2015-11-14 13:44:19	JayVii	also had to downgrade xorg to 1.17
2015-11-14 13:44:24	JayVii	:D
2015-11-14 13:44:27	Santo_101	haha, note to self: fuck debian
2015-11-14 13:44:34	JayVii	O.o
2015-11-14 13:44:44	JayVii	i have no problem with using kernel 3.16
2015-11-14 13:45:01	JayVii	i just wish, 4.1 was in the repos
2015-11-14 13:45:06	JayVii	it's LTS after all
2015-11-14 13:45:23	Santo_101	debian is so old school??
2015-11-14 13:46:00	JayVii	oldschool?
2015-11-14 13:46:03	JayVii	what do you mean?
2015-11-14 13:46:05	JayVii	lol
2015-11-14 13:46:31	Santo_101	btw, since your planning to run your own server these days, why not this one http://goo.gl/viJAom

2015-11-14 13:46:52	Santo_101	as you stated yourself, a bit outdated
2015-11-14 13:47:07	JayVii	well, i have no use for an IRC server O.o
2015-11-14 13:47:15	Santo_101	you do now
2015-11-14 13:47:29	JayVii	not outdated. with debian, you say "stable". it means the same thing, though. really.
2015-11-14 13:47:31	JayVii	hehe
2015-11-14 13:47:36	JayVii	just sounds nicer
2015-11-14 13:47:43	JayVii	and it's just the kernel and xorg
2015-11-14 13:47:50	JayVii	the rest is from unstable-repos
2015-11-14 13:48:03	 *	Santo_101 is really outdated and truely unstable
2015-11-14 13:48:19	JayVii	which has update-cycles every 4 hours or so

2015-11-14 18:51:30	+Piece_Maker	well i mean
2015-11-14 18:51:33	+Piece_Maker	the uni hub is like
2015-11-14 18:51:37	+Piece_Maker	about the same price as a whole bike
2015-11-14 18:51:38	+Piece_Maker	XDXD
2015-11-14 18:51:55	+Piece_Maker	looking at about £600-1000 depending who i ask, as theyre in short supply
2015-11-14 18:52:10	+Piece_Maker	plus id have to build it into a new wheel because my current wheel is 48-spoke and the hubs are 36 spoke
2015-11-14 18:52:52	+Piece_Maker	so its like... yeah, geared uni hub would be EPIC, i wouldnt even need a bike as a geared 36er uni would be just as fast as a 2-wheeler... but at th esame time, i could buy a whole bloody bike
2015-11-14 18:52:54	+Piece_Maker	:P

2015-11-16 22:20:15	+rypervenche	I wouldn't do Gentoo so much if in1t3r weren't upping i3 so often.
2015-11-16 22:20:46	psyq	he likes i3?
2015-11-16 22:21:05	+shymega	apparently
2015-11-16 22:21:15	+shymega	rypervenche: you use weechat on gentoo?
2015-11-16 22:21:23	+rypervenche	I do, yes.
2015-11-16 22:21:54	+shymega	oh right, i'm trying to get the python libs for weechat on gentoo, i can import it, but never call any useful functions
2015-11-16 22:21:57	+shymega	like register()
2015-11-16 22:22:12	+shymega	i wonder if it has to be interpreted by weechat itself for it to work
2015-11-16 22:22:37	+rypervenche	Did you add the python USE flag?
2015-11-16 22:23:09	+rypervenche	And are you using the same PYTHON_TARGETS version as the version of python you're using?
2015-11-16 22:23:12	+shymega	there's a lot of python USE flags xD, i've got python , python_single_target_python2_7 , python_targets_python2_7 and python_targets_python3_4
2015-11-16 22:23:21	+shymega	set
2015-11-16 22:23:30	+shymega	maybe 2_7 and 3_4 are conflicting
2015-11-16 22:23:35	+rypervenche	No, they won't conflict.
2015-11-16 22:23:47	+rypervenche	They will both be built. The single target would conflict if you had two, but you don't
2015-11-16 22:23:59	KDG-mac	!nano++
2015-11-16 22:24:01	+shymega	ok, odd

2015-11-16 22:24:06	+shymega	not nano btw

2015-11-16 23:14:17	KDG-mac	aha
2015-11-16 23:14:35	@pdq	yep usually $4.99 per month and the streamers get half the money and twitch gets the other half

2015-11-18 20:19:26	+shymega	well now that you mention it
2015-11-18 20:20:23	+shymega	i did think about that, i just never got past the thought process of 'that might be a good idea, trying it in a VM', i skipped to 'bye gentoo, i'm trying a OS i have no idea about and is potentially unstable'
2015-11-18 20:21:16	+rypervenche	So what happens if you want to revert back?
2015-11-18 20:21:55	+shymega	i reinstall Gentoo

2015-11-18 20:24:49	+rypervenche	Everytime I learn something new and then want to install it differently.
2015-11-18 20:24:56	+shymega	this had better be worth it

2015-11-18 21:51:54	psyq	how come there is a big dialog about if emacs is better then vim I don't get it really
2015-11-18 21:52:05	+shymega	it doesn't really matter
2015-11-18 21:52:15	+shymega	like, if your editor works, then fine, no need to fight over it
2015-11-18 21:52:28	+shymega	maybe i'm too young, but i just see the whole editor wars are counterproductive
2015-11-18 21:52:53	+shymega	and i say editor, but it could be a IDE, like eclipse
2015-11-18 21:53:14	+shymega	i'm not a fan of eclipse, but if it works for someone, then that's great :)
2015-11-18 21:53:31	+MatthewAllan93	i know what you mean shymega :), just thought i would let you know about it :)

2015-11-21 23:27:56	+Piece_Maker	as to me its not quite in line with 'the arch way'
2015-11-21 23:28:02	+Piece_Maker	but that doesnt make me hate it
2015-11-21 23:28:03	+Piece_Maker	xD
2015-11-21 23:28:29	+Piece_Maker	systemd is a bit complicated and has a lot of stoof... i reckon arch shouldve stuck with its regular init scripts
2015-11-21 23:29:10	+Piece_Maker	but thats not me dogging on systemd, thats me dogging on arch devs choosing one philosophy point over another (Presumably they went systemd purely to keep in line with their 'no patched code, purely upstream stuff' point :P

2015-11-22 01:24:00	psyq	JayVii: Lost forever is good too
2015-11-22 01:25:24	+JayVii	psyq: the entire album is cool :D it fucked up my library though :D I wrote a little bash-script that atomatically sorts all my music into folders. the issue was, that the album is called "Lost Forever // Lost Together", it it created some weird folder-constructions
2015-11-22 01:25:27	@pdq	wow youtube sucks now that they redid the My Subscriptions page
2015-11-22 01:25:51	+JayVii	i ended up changing the script to replace "/" with "_"
2015-11-22 01:26:05	@pdq	they no longer whow you any activity done by your subs like liked videos or videos addd to playlist - all it shows now is upload and that's it
2015-11-22 01:26:15	psyq	hey pdq 
2015-11-22 01:26:21	@pdq	they took the you out of youtube
2015-11-22 01:26:34	psyq	JayVii: what mp3 player is it you are using?
2015-11-22 01:26:41	+JayVii	mpd :D
2015-11-22 01:26:48	+JayVii	and ncmpcpp as a frontend
2015-11-22 01:27:15	+JayVii	doesn't integrate well with KDEconnect, though
2015-11-22 01:27:24	+JayVii	so i might change to some GUI thing
2015-11-22 01:27:26	+JayVii	maybe
2015-11-22 01:27:52	psyq	why
2015-11-22 01:28:07	psyq	cli players are the best ones out there
2015-11-22 01:28:09	psyq	:)
2015-11-22 01:29:53	@pdq	i used to be able to spend an hour going through subscriptions page on youtube checking out all the new channels my subs subscribed to, all the videos they liked, now i'm done browing the subs page in 5 mins cause all it contains is my subs uploads, damn does youtube ever suck
2015-11-22 01:30:44	+JayVii	psyq: agreed. but it doesn
2015-11-22 01:30:54	+JayVii	doesn't* integrate well with kdeconnect
2015-11-22 01:30:56	+JayVii	:D
2015-11-22 01:31:13	+JayVii	how am i supposed to skip music from my bed?
2015-11-22 01:31:21	psyq	pdq: well that is what happenes when they get too big
2015-11-22 01:31:30	psyq	JayVii: what is kdeconnect?
2015-11-22 01:31:31	+JayVii	well, i could take my netbook, ssh into my PC and do it from there
2015-11-22 01:31:33	@pdq	so they get rid of the recommended videos by the people i follow but they keep the (useless)recommended by youtube page - google sucks so bad :P
2015-11-22 01:31:33	+JayVii	haha
2015-11-22 01:32:02	psyq	hahaha
2015-11-22 01:32:36	+JayVii	psyq: very cool remote control for linux desktops. developed for and by KDE, but it works with any DE/WM :D
2015-11-22 01:32:47	+JayVii	remote control from your android phone, that is
2015-11-22 01:32:59	+JayVii	mouse / keyboard control, mediaplayer control
2015-11-22 01:33:02	+JayVii	clipboard sharing
2015-11-22 01:33:15	+Piece_Maker	JayVii: if you want a good KDEconnect thingy for MPD
2015-11-22 01:33:18	+Piece_Maker	look at mpDris2
2015-11-22 01:33:19	+JayVii	it even shows notifications from your android phone on your desktop
2015-11-22 01:33:24	+Piece_Maker	it makes MPD have mpris support
2015-11-22 01:33:26	+JayVii	thanks Piece_Maker 
2015-11-22 01:33:34	+Piece_Maker	which just about EVERYthing in the entire world supports, including KDe connect hehe
2015-11-22 01:34:20	+JayVii	i'm using spotify a lot lately. sadly the webclient doesn't integrate either (obviously)
2015-11-22 01:34:37	+JayVii	and if i use the native client I have ads every 30 minutes :(+
2015-11-22 01:34:40	+JayVii	:(
2015-11-22 01:35:06	psyq	I hate that all the time
2015-11-22 01:35:22	+JayVii	i don't get ads in the webclient, hehe
2015-11-22 01:36:06	psyq	JayVii: msjche is/was using I don't know if he still uses it, a cli spotify client
2015-11-22 01:36:27	+JayVii	yeah, but you need spotify premium for that :D
2015-11-22 01:36:35	psyq	okie
2015-11-22 01:36:39	psyq	well I have that
2015-11-22 01:37:01	+JayVii	spotify can be used with a variety of musicplayers (including mpd & clementine), but only if you have Spotify Premium
2015-11-22 01:37:22	+JayVii	i think offline-mode is only available in the native client, though

2015-11-22 01:39:42	+JayVii	https://www.mopidy.com/
2015-11-22 01:41:20	+Piece_Maker	i thought MPD could support spotify links natively anyway
2015-11-22 01:41:24	+Piece_Maker	or is that soundclud
2015-11-22 01:41:49	+JayVii	i would think soundcloud
2015-11-22 01:42:03	+JayVii	spotify needs some library anyway
2015-11-22 01:42:11	+JayVii	even if you have premium
2015-11-22 01:42:24	+JayVii	the spotify-extension is a proprietary library thing
2015-11-22 01:42:41	+JayVii	didn't read much on that, because i don't have spotify premium
2015-11-22 01:43:37	+JayVii	9.99€ / month :(
2015-11-22 01:43:46	+JayVii	4.99€ / month for students, though
2015-11-22 01:43:58	psyq	still not good
2015-11-22 01:44:09	+JayVii	right
2015-11-22 01:44:27	psyq	anyways I am off to sleep I have work later today another 11 hours :(
2015-11-22 01:44:43	+JayVii	i can have netflix for 3€ (12€ for a 4 ppl license). why is music more expensive than movies?
2015-11-22 01:44:49	+JayVii	okay, night psyq

2015-11-22 21:35:07	+Acou_Bass	cool
2015-11-22 21:35:13	+JayVii	no surprise as far as Tumbleweed goes
2015-11-22 21:35:17	+MatthewAllan93	JayVii: is that on your main rig?
2015-11-22 21:35:23	+JayVii	but not sure if it was a good decision for Leap
2015-11-22 21:35:28	+JayVii	MatthewAllan93: yup
2015-11-22 21:35:38	+MatthewAllan93	oh good :)
2015-11-22 21:35:42	+Acou_Bass	yeah i thought leap was supposed to be old-stable :P but still cool
2015-11-22 21:35:50	+JayVii	MatthewAllan93: the netbook has a 1024x600 screen. I guess you would notice haha
2015-11-22 21:35:52	+Acou_Bass	i really liked suse when i tried it
2015-11-22 21:36:04	+JayVii	Acou_Bass: Evergreen is old-stable
2015-11-22 21:36:08	+MatthewAllan93	JayVii: haha yes :P
2015-11-22 21:36:25	+Acou_Bass	i thought Leap was supposed to be like
2015-11-22 21:36:29	+JayVii	afaik, 13.1 will be an evergreen release
2015-11-22 21:36:29	+Acou_Bass	old-stable base and newer packages
2015-11-22 21:36:51	+JayVii	so 13.1 will be supported longer than 13.2 hehe
2015-11-22 21:36:53	+Acou_Bass	though i know leap is SLES code instead of openSUSE
2015-11-22 21:37:05	+Acou_Bass	yeah 13.1 was an evergreen, basically their version of an LTS
2015-11-22 21:37:11	+JayVii	right
2015-11-22 21:37:36	+JayVii	debian's oldstable branch also tries to be a LTS
2015-11-22 21:37:46	+JayVii	community effort
2015-11-22 21:37:49	+Acou_Bass	hehe
2015-11-22 21:38:20	+Acou_Bass	i might give leap a go at some point if my arch box crashes out on me
2015-11-22 21:38:35	+Acou_Bass	when i ran suse 13.2 it was alright BUT i had a lot of deal-breaker problems on it
2015-11-22 21:38:37	+Acou_Bass	maybe leap will fix those
2015-11-22 21:38:47	+JayVii	don't use Leap
2015-11-22 21:39:01	+JayVii	OpenSUSE's point-releases have a lot of issues
2015-11-22 21:39:12	+JayVii	they tend to be usable ~ 1 year after release
2015-11-22 21:39:19	+JayVii	Tumbleweed works fine, though
2015-11-22 21:39:19	+Acou_Bass	yeah really dumb issues too when i tried it -_- xd
2015-11-22 21:39:21	+JayVii	lol
2015-11-22 21:39:28	+JayVii	missing packages and stuff
2015-11-22 21:39:37	+Acou_Bass	only reason i didnt go with tumbleweed was because a lot of packages were missing..
2015-11-22 21:39:39	+Acou_Bass	XD
2015-11-22 21:39:50	+Acou_Bass	like, id search software.opensuse.org and all the packages would be available for 13.2 but not tumbleweed
2015-11-22 21:39:53	+Acou_Bass	:P
2015-11-22 21:40:08	+JayVii	when I tried 13.2 (1 week after release), the OFFICIAL(!) way of installing fglrx (amd-drivers) was to convert a .deb from some ppa
2015-11-22 21:40:27	+JayVii	Acou_Bass: i found everything for tumbleweed as well :O
2015-11-22 21:40:30	+Acou_Bass	i didnt try 13.2 when it was brand new i dont think, i think it was a few months old...
2015-11-22 21:40:32	+Acou_Bass	XD
2015-11-22 21:40:35	+Acou_Bass	but like
2015-11-22 21:40:50	+Acou_Bass	SSH didnt work, samba didnt work, all really basic shit like that
2015-11-22 21:40:52	+JayVii	I'd go with 13.1 hehe
2015-11-22 21:40:53	+Acou_Bass	just didnt work
2015-11-22 21:40:58	+Acou_Bass	and there was really no reason whatsoever for it not to work
2015-11-22 21:41:19	+JayVii	my ssh doesn't work either. it has to do with the damn firewall and sshd not being activated by default
2015-11-22 21:41:29	+JayVii	gotta sort that out one of these days
2015-11-22 21:41:30	+Acou_Bass	i turned the firewall off and turned SSH to always be on
2015-11-22 21:41:32	+Acou_Bass	and it still failed ;S
2015-11-22 21:42:23	+JayVii	yast2 is extremely demanding. worse than anything people say about systemd
2015-11-22 21:42:30	+JayVii	yast2 wants to do EVERYTHING
2015-11-22 21:42:37	+JayVii	it's like vlc-player on windows
2015-11-22 21:42:45	+Acou_Bass	yeah but its only a wrapper for other software really
2015-11-22 21:42:47	+Acou_Bass	so its good, i like yast
2015-11-22 21:43:03	+JayVii	once you installed vlc on windows, it tries to open videos, music, pictures and DAMN .bin FILES with it
2015-11-22 21:43:11	+Acou_Bass	XD
2015-11-22 21:43:55	+JayVii	it would try to open websites, if it had a built-in html renderer

2015-11-22 21:50:06	DQSII	not saying vlc is bad its great i just have no use for it now xD
2015-11-22 21:50:31	+JayVii	smplayer for me now (I'd use mpv without it, but that doesn't provide remote control. vlc has seeking issues and mplayer is just a mess...)
2015-11-22 21:50:49	+JayVii	i configured smplayer to not have an interface at all, though
2015-11-22 21:50:53	+JayVii	so i don't mind
2015-11-22 21:50:58	+JayVii	looks like using standard mpv
2015-11-22 21:51:26	+JayVii	and integrates well with kdeconnect :)
2015-11-22 21:51:39	DQSII	well i think everyone knows what i use xD

2015-11-23 00:58:21	+JayVii	dwm is a tiling wm, right?
2015-11-23 00:58:58	+JayVii	i used i3 and awesomeWM, but figured a floating WM suits me more. the only things I tile are terminals and I might as well use tmux for that
2015-11-23 00:59:25	+JayVii	i set up my desktops to be 100% keyboard controlled, though
2015-11-23 00:59:33	+JayVii	and make heavy use of workspaces (usually 9)
2015-11-23 00:59:43	+JayVii	so that's something i liked about tiling WM's
2015-11-23 01:00:39	chry	Dwm is both tiling and floating...
2015-11-23 01:01:21	+JayVii	well, most tiling wm's have multiple modes
2015-11-23 01:01:23	+JayVii	:D
2015-11-23 01:01:54	chry	Yeah, but in dwm's case it's much more simplified...
2015-11-23 01:02:20	chry	But such simple wms can become a bit boring after a while...
2015-11-23 01:03:16	chry	In which case I like to switch to fluxbox or openbox...
2015-11-23 01:04:30	+JayVii	:)
2015-11-23 01:05:28	+Acou_Bass	i use awesomeWM but the majority of the time leave it in floating mode
2015-11-23 01:05:41	+Acou_Bass	because tiling is poo
2015-11-23 01:05:57	psyq	me too JayVii 
2015-11-23 01:06:32	psyq	JayVii: how did u get the dmenu to work in kde
2015-11-23 01:08:23	+JayVii	i'm not using it right now, as krunner is a bit faster (if the kde-workspace is loaded anyway), but I did use dmenu in kde before. kde doesn't really allow you to use commands for hotkeys, so i created a .desktop file with the dmenu command and all args
2015-11-23 01:08:36	+JayVii	then you would bind some key to that .desktop file
2015-11-23 01:09:43	psyq	okie I guess someday I would be able to do the same
2015-11-23 01:09:46	+JayVii	the command for dmenu i'm using is "dmenu_run -i -fn Terminus:pixelsize=20 -nb black -nf green -sb green -sf black"
2015-11-23 01:09:53	+JayVii	play around with the args
2015-11-23 01:09:56	+JayVii	if you want
2015-11-23 01:10:34	psyq	sure I will
2015-11-23 01:10:36	+JayVii	hm... i cannot remember what "-i" was for
2015-11-23 01:11:00	+JayVii	if you want it to be on the bottom, rather than the top of your screen, use "-b"
2015-11-23 01:11:18	+JayVii	dmenu's man-page tells you all about the parameters, though
2015-11-23 01:11:40	+JayVii	anyway. it's getting late here and i have to get up in 5 hours again -.-"
2015-11-23 01:11:45	+JayVii	so have a nice evening :)

2015-11-26 21:08:22	+rypervenche_	It shows it as better than Dvorak on all accounts, but it doesn't seem to be that way. But I suppose it all depends on how you type as well.
2015-11-26 21:09:21	+rypervenche_	Well, when I say "go back and forth" it's more like, "I still don't know which one I want to use because I need really good reasons to decide on one, decide for good".

2015-11-26 21:48:53	+rypervenche_	shymega: Dvorak focused on popular bcigraphs in the English language. So the most-used is "th", and it's on kj on the qwerty keyboard. Colemak just focused on being able to type more words on the home row. Dvorak also focuses on hand alternation, whereas Colemak believes in typing a few letters on one hand in good.

2015-11-27 23:55:33	@pdq	Acou_Bass: a thread about playing csgo with steam controllers hehe
2015-11-27 23:55:46	+Acou_Bass	i think the problem there is
2015-11-27 23:55:56	+Acou_Bass	those pro teams will like, live and breathe mouse/kb usage
2015-11-27 23:56:00	@pdq	give em a week or to get used to it
2015-11-27 23:56:20	+Acou_Bass	steam controllers only been out two months, i reckon give it a year before therers a pro team who uses them and actually is able to compete hehe
2015-11-27 23:56:26	@pdq	true but pros are way better at game the na n00b trying to use it hehe
2015-11-27 23:56:38	@pdq	and n00bs have been doing pretty good in videos iseen
2015-11-27 23:56:45	+Acou_Bass	XD i guess :P
2015-11-27 23:57:00	+Acou_Bass	but its not about being good at game, its about being good at controller use ;D
2015-11-27 23:57:04	+Acou_Bass	well, obviously game too
2015-11-27 23:57:05	@pdq	i don;t think will ever be able to compete but i could see there being a league for it
2015-11-27 23:57:28	@pdq	yeah but you need to klnow crosshair placement etc
2015-11-27 23:57:38	+Acou_Bass	well, if there does become a league for it, which would be epic
2015-11-27 23:57:44	@pdq	a new user woudl take years to learn that on kbb or controller
2015-11-27 23:57:58	@pdq	yeah
2015-11-27 23:58:06	+Acou_Bass	controllers would get all the same love 'n attention off peripheral manufacturers that kb/mouse do, because theres pros who want even better ones than the steam one hehe
2015-11-27 23:58:26	+Acou_Bass	happens in all pro sports
2015-11-27 23:58:34	@pdq	i'm sure there could be people who could beat most kb and mosue players using it but if al lthings balanced can't compete
2015-11-27 23:58:49	@pdq	yeah
2015-11-27 23:58:54	+Acou_Bass	not right now probably not
2015-11-27 23:58:58	+Acou_Bass	but if they make a league for it
2015-11-27 23:59:08	+Acou_Bass	someone like razor or something will make even better controllers
2015-11-27 23:59:17	@pdq	yeah
2015-11-27 23:59:37	@pdq	and new schema and whatnot created as people discorver whats best
2015-11-28 00:00:01	+Acou_Bass	road bikes never had disk brakes on them at al until the pros started riding them, now theyre becoming a standard because the bike manufacturers have made bikes with them on, and the brakes have gotten better/lighter/more reliable etc.
2015-11-28 00:00:13	@pdq	cool
2015-11-28 00:00:15	+Acou_Bass	same thing happens to ALL equipment in all sports
2015-11-28 00:00:21	+Acou_Bass	so same thing will happen if pros start using controllers
2015-11-28 00:00:23	@pdq	that's what i like best about it is that in a year from now or even a month from now it will be so much better than now
2015-11-28 00:00:24	+Acou_Bass	;D
2015-11-28 00:00:28	@pdq	yep
2015-11-28 00:01:15	+Acou_Bass	steam controller was made for playing PC games in a console-like setting though, not for competing at pro level
2015-11-28 00:01:25	+Acou_Bass	so probably isnt the best thing to compare to kb/mouse hehe
2015-11-28 00:01:39	@pdq	compared to xbox controller though
2015-11-28 00:01:49	@pdq	all the components exist
2015-11-28 00:01:51	+Acou_Bass	oh yeah
2015-11-28 00:01:57	+Acou_Bass	its lightyears ahead of xbox controller
2015-11-28 00:02:02	@pdq	is just like a real scaled down kb and mosue setup hehe
2015-11-28 00:02:04	+Acou_Bass	right-hand thumbsticks are dumb as fook
2015-11-28 00:02:11	+Acou_Bass	touchpad works wayyyy beter :D

2015-11-28 00:18:31	+Acou_Bass	cars are far too dangerous and have a ridiculous culture surrounding them, id rather not be part of it
2015-11-28 00:18:47	@pdq	yeah
2015-11-28 00:19:03	+Acou_Bass	i always said, if you want to murder someone and get away with it
2015-11-28 00:19:04	@pdq	is more safe in some regards though if you have to share roads with them though
2015-11-28 00:19:06	+Acou_Bass	hit 'em with your car
2015-11-28 00:19:18	+Acou_Bass	chances are you just tell the cops you didnt see them
2015-11-28 00:19:22	+Acou_Bass	and youll get away scot free
2015-11-28 00:19:32	@pdq	i thoguht it was a deer
2015-11-28 00:19:49	@pdq	a dear riding a bike
2015-11-28 00:19:52	@pdq	deer
2015-11-28 00:20:09	@pdq	so i ran over it, was scary :P
2015-11-28 00:20:21	+Acou_Bass	oh that dude on a bike didnt have a helmet on?! oh, doesnt matter if you ran over him then, his fault for not having a lid
2015-11-28 00:21:06	+Acou_Bass	y'know, lets ignore the whole part about how you shouldnt have hit him in the first place
2015-11-28 00:21:34	+BallmerPeak	pdq hit a guy with a car?!?!  (that's what I just gathered from the above conversation...)
2015-11-28 00:21:40	+Acou_Bass	XD no
2015-11-28 00:21:44	+Acou_Bass	i dont think.. 0,o
2015-11-28 00:21:45	@pdq	in small town i live near is great for bmx
2015-11-28 00:21:59	+Acou_Bass	im just ranting about car culture BallmerPeak ignore mee;D
2015-11-28 00:22:05	@pdq	can bike without havign to go on main roads and can take alleys and sidewalks and parks etc
2015-11-28 00:22:12	+BallmerPeak	lol, ok Acou_Bass 
2015-11-28 00:22:45	+Acou_Bass	hehe pdq if i ride on the sidewalk i get jumped by cops... while they ignore all the idiots who drive half-on the sidewalk because theyre trying to park or something
2015-11-28 00:22:48	@pdq	i don;t think i would notice if i hit anyone in my truck
2015-11-28 00:23:31	+Acou_Bass	though we have looadss of SUSTRANS routes round here which are good enough to ride to just about everywhere
2015-11-28 00:23:51	@pdq	nice
2015-11-28 00:24:11	+Acou_Bass	the militant cyclist brigade hate the sustrans routes because they sort of make you ride slower
2015-11-28 00:24:19	+Acou_Bass	which suits me and my uni just fine
2015-11-28 00:24:22	+Acou_Bass	XD
2015-11-28 00:25:37	@pdq	as long as is no cars etc is cool
2015-11-28 00:26:07	+Acou_Bass	yeah most of the sustrans routes are off-road (Not mountain bike off-road, just like, forest tracks and canal towpaths)
2015-11-28 00:26:28	+Acou_Bass	theyre usually a bit narrow and unpaved, so you end up riding slower on them

2015-11-28 00:28:03	@pdq	it
2015-11-28 00:28:13	+Acou_Bass	some of them are about sidewalk-width
2015-11-28 00:28:23	+Acou_Bass	but some of the canal towpaths are so narrow you cant fit 2 bikes down them

2015-11-28 00:28:25	+Acou_Bass	:P
2015-11-28 00:28:33	+Acou_Bass	specially when they duck under bridges
2015-11-28 00:29:02	+Acou_Bass	i think thats the main problem with the sustrans routes... theyre not standardized
2015-11-28 00:29:11	+Acou_Bass	sot hey can slap a sustrans route sign on just about anything and call it a cycle path
2015-11-28 00:29:13	+Acou_Bass	XD
2015-11-28 00:30:59	+Acou_Bass	some of them are poorly or totally unlit too so are soemtimes a hotbed for muggers

2015-11-28 23:07:33	spirou_	I could like streamlined too
2015-11-28 23:07:57	Kerea	so driver wise, the kernel only has the modules for hardware that's specific to my desktop
2015-11-28 23:07:59	spirou_	perhaps switched to noatime?

2015-11-28 23:09:07	Kerea	how long it takes depends on how well you know your system hardware and the kernel modules that it uses
2015-11-28 23:09:24	Kerea	compile time takes about 5-10 minutes depending on your MAKEOPTS in the make.conf file

2015-11-28 23:12:50	spirou_	if I know ubuntu right, the kernel I (linuxmint17) have at the moment probably has everything extra all in it plus extra cheese, so if just remove stuff I know I don't want I guess that would be a good thing to do.
2015-11-28 23:13:16	spirou_	Acou_Bass: for the disks that I don't mount permanently in /etc/fstab I mean
2015-11-28 23:13:25	+Acou_Bass	ahh

2015-11-28 23:14:43	Kerea	the biggest difference you'll notice mainly is that your boot time will be much quicker since it's not having to load every driver module during the boot up process
2015-11-28 23:15:26	Linux4Today	*atime options can also be passed with the mount commant
2015-11-28 23:15:37	Linux4Today	mount -o relatime ...
2015-11-28 23:16:28	spirou_	Kerea: ok I should search for some (non-video) tutorials before I try.
2015-11-28 23:16:41	Kerea	non-video tutorials are usually more detailed
2015-11-28 23:17:02	Kerea	a video helps if you just want to see a quick rundown of how it's done
2015-11-28 23:17:18	@Irishluck83	hey Linux4Today 
2015-11-28 23:17:23	Linux4Today	hi
2015-11-28 23:17:45	spirou_	Linux4Today: I normally never write mount commands, I just click on it in the filemanager... so it is for that I want to set what it will do....
2015-11-28 23:19:06	Kerea	i would encourage you to learn some command line basics
2015-11-28 23:19:17	Linux4Today	what?! .. what is this "file manager" you speak of?! is that like mc? ;P
2015-11-28 23:19:26	Kerea	a lot of the power in Linux is in the terminal
2015-11-28 23:19:33	spirou_	Kerea: it is mostly that I prefer non-video tutorials with pictures [read that as "I hate slow video tutorials for stuff" hehe]
2015-11-28 23:22:52	Kerea	yea i know what you mean about slow video stuff. Most written tutorials don't have screenshots though and I'm personally very much a visual learner
2015-11-28 23:23:03	spirou_	Linux4Today: mm.... while midnightcommander is nice and all it doesn't really compare to a non-terminal program with real gui  :)
2015-11-28 23:23:11	Kerea	i'm more likely to not only better understand what i'm doing what i'm seeing it, i'm also more likely to remember the steps involved
2015-11-28 23:23:55	Kerea	command line basics are simply just knowing enough to navigate around the directory structure
2015-11-28 23:24:14	Kerea	view files, delete files, move files etc. etc.
2015-11-28 23:24:28	spirou_	I haven't found a really good replacement of TotalCommander for linux yet though... with good folder compare and that
2015-11-28 23:24:35	Kerea	it helps if you can visualize the GUI file manager as you're navigating the tree in the terminal
2015-11-28 23:24:56	Kerea	ranger is my favorite terminal file manager

2015-11-28 23:29:13	spirou_	and while I do know he unix command line basics, it is just that every time I do something more than that I always have to look it up in man. takes time. And besides, the man helpfiles is really bad.

2015-11-28 23:29:33	+Acou_Bass	yeah
2015-11-28 23:29:41	+Acou_Bass	i only really use basic shell commands for usual file managing
2015-11-28 23:29:44	+Acou_Bass	like cp/mv/cd
2015-11-28 23:31:45	Kerea	man pages aren't exactly the most user friendly guides
2015-11-28 23:31:52	spirou_	yeah and some chmod and such, but then if I want to write say a mount command line... let see here what flag should I use for this and that, and do I have to tell what filesystem this is (do I even know?), what am I supposed to write for a fat32 it was something else name for that and....
2015-11-28 23:32:01	Kerea	they're meant as references for people who are already familiar with the commands they're running

2015-11-29 00:05:57	Linux4Today	after install and reboot it complains about not having a bootable drive

2015-11-30 13:10:42	+alexandros_c	I think you have to set it in grub config
2015-11-30 13:15:16	psyq	but will that stay as system wide or just at boot?
2015-11-30 13:16:06	+alexandros_c	boot screen is separate from system screen
2015-11-30 13:17:05	psyq	okie hehehe
2015-11-30 13:17:14	+alexandros_c	you will have to set the resolution by the mechanism provided by whatever de/wm you are using.
2015-11-30 13:17:40	psyq	then it is the system screen I wanted to change
2015-11-30 13:18:06	psyq	okie so if I am using i3 I can put in the xrandr in the conf file?
2015-11-30 13:18:59	+alexandros_c	sorry can't help you there as I use the resolution set by the system

2015-11-30 14:52:26	+Mastermind1	Tell me all about it :)
2015-11-30 14:52:57	+Acou_Bass	its interesting... XD i like it
2015-11-30 14:53:26	+Acou_Bass	took a bit of faffing to get the xbox controller emulation to work, and some games lack usable configs for it so ive had to  create a few
2015-11-30 14:53:53	+Mastermind1	can you use it to control your OS mouse maybe with some tweaking?
2015-11-30 14:54:03	+Acou_Bass	it works OOTB as a mouse hehe
2015-11-30 14:54:22	+Mastermind1	Ooohh nice
2015-11-30 14:54:28	+Acou_Bass	soon as i plug it in my mouse twitches... the two back triggers act as mouse buttons, and the other buttons act as scroll and stuff
2015-11-30 14:54:29	+Mastermind1	I thought that was only in bigpic mode
2015-11-30 14:54:43	+Acou_Bass	and i think the thumbstick acts as WASD
2015-11-30 14:55:44	+Acou_Bass	to actually configure the buttons to do anything useful unfortunately does require big picture mode
2015-11-30 14:55:52	+Mastermind1	Nice
2015-11-30 14:56:07	+Acou_Bass	there is a 3rd party tool some dude made but its super-early and i cant actually get it to work xD
2015-11-30 14:56:07	+Mastermind1	Does it handle as you expected?
2015-11-30 14:56:50	+Acou_Bass	aside from the xbox controller emulation that i couldnt get working, yeah XD
2015-11-30 14:57:04	+Acou_Bass	the touchpad-as-mouse thingy works great
2015-11-30 14:57:56	+Mastermind1	Accurate enough after some getting used to?
2015-11-30 14:58:35	+Acou_Bass	yeah and it didnt take me long to get used to it either
2015-11-30 14:59:04	+Acou_Bass	my only problem really is by default its super-fast, so hard to actually use accurately which i think is why people use the gyro for small accurate shots

2015-11-30 15:18:53	+Acou_Bass	anyone after that level of security likely isnt using it for the thing they advertise it as being useful for

2015-11-30 15:19:21	+Mastermind1	Why not?
2015-11-30 15:19:34	+Mastermind1	I would find it interesting to use compartimantilazation with whole OS'es instead of just applications
2015-11-30 15:19:57	+Acou_Bass	im mostly worried about the performance hit
2015-11-30 15:20:08	+Acou_Bass	like... containers are one thing, but whole VM's? =\
2015-11-30 15:20:47	+Mastermind1	I think its pretty neglegent
2015-11-30 15:20:47	+Mastermind1	Maybe not for games
2015-11-30 15:21:07	+Acou_Bass	i guess id have to see the actual desktop intergration they claim to provide
2015-11-30 15:21:22	+Acou_Bass	because otherwise i could easily just get the same setup with something like openSUSE setup with Xen/KVM hehe
2015-11-30 15:21:53	+Mastermind1	Yeah that is the whole point
2015-11-30 15:21:53	+Mastermind1	Easy of use
2015-11-30 15:22:19	+Acou_Bass	well see i guess :P
2015-11-30 15:22:41	+Acou_Bass	probably the best VM i ever saw was OSX's parallels, that shit is definitely desktop user-friendly to an extreme
2015-11-30 15:23:03	+Acou_Bass	itd be interesting to see if qubes can create something that noob-friendly yet use the power of good VM tech like kvm :D
2015-11-30 15:23:38	+Mastermind1	Yeah if this would be kvm with SPICE instead of Xen....
2015-11-30 15:23:38	+Mastermind1	that would be cool

2015-11-30 18:27:41	+MatthewAllan93	possibly by using the xmpp protocol, i think
2015-11-30 18:28:26	Dusan_Mitrovic	Well I tried that but I'm not sure how to properly add a facebook account. I press the add button but nothing happens.
2015-11-30 18:30:32	+MatthewAllan93	what details did you include in the login
2015-11-30 18:30:53	Dusan_Mitrovic	my facebook username and password
2015-11-30 18:31:17	+MatthewAllan93	ok did you include the @chat.facebook.com on the username?

2015-12-01 23:09:28	+MatthewAllan93	kleptos: oh :(
2015-12-01 23:09:33	Kerea	applied information technology
2015-12-01 23:09:54	+MatthewAllan93	oh good :)
2015-12-01 23:10:24	Kerea	it was basically a mix of everything, programming with a focus on C#, Oracle SQL, ASP.NET web page design, ethical hacking, advanced networking, telecommunication, app design etc. etc.
2015-12-01 23:10:50	Kerea	the program was pretty microsoft focused which was the only thing i didn't really like about it
2015-12-01 23:10:56	+MatthewAllan93	yes it sounds like my computing degree :)
2015-12-01 23:10:59	Kerea	would have been nice to have a class on GIMP instead of photoshop
2015-12-01 23:11:08	Kerea	or PHP and MySQL instead of ASP.NET
2015-12-01 23:11:23	+MatthewAllan93	yes i know what you mean
2015-12-01 23:11:26	Kerea	i didn't mind Oracle 11g because Oracle SQL is pretty widely used, and it's not that hard to adapt to MySQL
2015-12-01 23:11:52	+MatthewAllan93	colleges and universities need to educate more on open source programs 
2015-12-01 23:12:17	Kerea	C# is becoming more widely taught
2015-12-01 23:12:29	Kerea	which is both good and bad i suppose
2015-12-01 23:12:46	+MatthewAllan93	yes true
2015-12-01 23:12:47	Kerea	good because it makes it so more people are able to program without having as deep of understanding of the lower level stuff
2015-12-01 23:12:58	Kerea	but it's bad because it teaches sloppy programming habits
2015-12-01 23:16:40	Kerea	right now i'm dipping a bit further into C and Python so i can start tinkering at a deeper level
2015-12-01 23:16:50	Kerea	linux practically runs on those 2 languages
2015-12-01 23:17:00	+MatthewAllan93	oh good :), very true 
2015-12-01 23:18:08	Kerea	i think i would've enjoyed the bat program a lot more if they'd taught C or Python instead of C#
2015-12-01 23:18:22	Kerea	imo they should just teach python, it's less complicated syntax wise and easier to grasp
2015-12-01 23:18:38	Kerea	and it still gives you the flexbility of teaching OOP concepts
2015-12-01 23:21:12	+MatthewAllan93	i get what you mean, it would be better if they teached python :)

2015-12-02 20:32:06	+JayVii	I probably go with void, though

2015-12-02 20:43:36	theShirbiny	does it have anything like the AUR?
2015-12-02 20:43:37	+JayVii	eventhough it does have some similarities
2015-12-02 20:43:52	+JayVii	it comes barebones, after installation
2015-12-02 20:43:58	+JayVii	at least with the standard ISO
2015-12-02 20:44:18	+JayVii	theShirbiny: nope. however, the community populates the main repos

2015-12-02 20:45:51	+JayVii	if your template gets accepted (if you follow their very strict rules), they merge your PR and within an hour or so (depending on the build-time), it is avialble in the repos
2015-12-02 20:46:02	+JayVii	i submitted a package there myself
2015-12-02 20:46:06	psyq	oohh I didn't know that

2015-12-06 20:17:47	+Acou_Bass	as far as i can tell, its loosely based on the terminology look
2015-12-06 20:18:01	+Acou_Bass	you can even do the same tab-switchy magic terminology does with the little blue square thing in the top right

2015-12-06 20:21:41	+Acou_Bass	ive never used void but uhh
2015-12-06 20:21:43	+Acou_Bass	i choose void
2015-12-06 20:21:47	+Acou_Bass	because i dont see the point in source distros

2015-12-06 20:22:11	+JayVii	yeah... probably. dualcore + compile isn't that cool

2015-12-06 20:22:29	+Acou_Bass	i dont see why compiling is useful at all
2015-12-06 20:22:39	+Acou_Bass	except for things like running bleeding-edge git code where packages arent available

2015-12-06 20:23:18	+Acou_Bass	in gentoo? sure you can
2015-12-06 20:23:26	+JayVii	because void moved over to xorg 1.18
2015-12-06 20:23:32	+JayVii	in void
2015-12-06 20:23:35	+Acou_Bass	ahhhh right yeah
2015-12-06 20:24:11	+JayVii	I could, however take the blaupause of the older xorg
2015-12-06 20:24:20	+JayVii	from the githib history
2015-12-06 20:24:40	+JayVii	and compile it myself without any hassle
2015-12-06 20:24:43	+Acou_Bass	surely they provide legacy packages for this sort of thing? XD
2015-12-06 20:25:07	+JayVii	I dind't check for that, but I doubt it
2015-12-06 20:25:23	+Acou_Bass	for old-xorg drivers like that there were 3rd-party repos for arch
2015-12-06 20:25:32	+Acou_Bass	i had to use them for my ATI card
2015-12-06 20:25:39	+JayVii	when they moved to 1.18, they advised people to put xorg on hold
2015-12-06 20:25:48	+Acou_Bass	yarr
2015-12-06 20:26:06	+JayVii	thing is, my gpu now is considered legacy
2015-12-06 20:26:09	+JayVii	so amd won't orivide new drivers
2015-12-06 20:26:15	+JayVii	provide
2015-12-06 20:26:31	+Acou_Bass	yeahh, thast what happened to me
2015-12-06 20:26:41	+Acou_Bass	i pulled legacy drivers + old xorg version from a 3d party repo on arch
2015-12-06 20:26:46	+Acou_Bass	no iea how void handles that sorta stuff though :P
2015-12-06 20:28:31	+JayVii	which card do you have?
2015-12-06 20:29:04	+Acou_Bass	these days its an nvidia 650 TI bost but back then it was an ATI 4350
2015-12-06 20:29:17	+JayVii	I can download the build-template for old xorg. xbos can build it for me, without me doing anything
2015-12-06 20:29:37	+Acou_Bass	hehe

2015-12-06 20:29:44	+Acou_Bass	and i guess youll only need to do it once
2015-12-06 20:29:48	+JayVii	then, I simply put it on hold, so it won't replace it with the binary from the repos

2015-12-07 21:56:02	+rypervenche	Aaaaaand, bought.
2015-12-07 21:58:41	+rypervenche	Going with something very simple: https://d.ryper.org/keyboard.png
2015-12-07 22:07:53	psyq	that one looks really nice
2015-12-07 22:08:21	psyq	I am trying to get it without the numpad
2015-12-07 22:08:29	+rypervenche	I thought about doing the numbers a different color, but meh.
2015-12-07 22:08:40	+rypervenche	You can. They have different keyboard layouts.
2015-12-07 22:09:14	psyq	I know I just didn't find the one where you can change it from US to DK
2015-12-07 22:12:18	+rypervenche	And I went with brown switches because they are quiet and you can still feel the bump. I just watched a few videos from Youtube about "cherry switches".
2015-12-07 22:12:35	+rypervenche	psyq: You probably have to make a custom one for that.
2015-12-07 22:12:36	psyq	yeah me too
2015-12-07 22:12:58	psyq	okie I will look around for that one
2015-12-07 22:17:20	psyq	i will just make it blank heheh
2015-12-07 22:17:43	◀▬▬	Optichip (~Optichip@162.221.37.8) has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2015-12-07 22:21:46	+rypervenche	I have mine like that. I would buy another like that, but this new keyboard is to help me learn Dvorak.
2015-12-07 22:22:06	+rypervenche	Once I am proficient in it, I will get another blank one. Love them.^^
2015-12-07 22:22:37	psyq	okie but why u want to learn Dvorak
2015-12-07 22:24:07	+rypervenche	I've been typing on it for a week or two now. I like it a lot. A LOT less movement on my keyboard and my fingers are not as tired.
2015-12-07 22:25:53	psyq	I have never tired it before
2015-12-07 22:26:23	psyq	is it like closer together or what is the idea behiden it
2015-12-07 22:26:40	+rypervenche	I tried it once before. It can take a while to get used to the keyboard.
2015-12-07 22:27:11	+rypervenche	It is less strain on your fingers. To type "the" you type kjd on the qwerty keyboard.
2015-12-07 22:27:40	+rypervenche	You type more ofter on the home row and you have very few bottom row reaches.
2015-12-07 22:27:44	+rypervenche	often*
2015-12-07 22:28:35	psyq	that sounds really nice but then you will have to get one for work too and your laptop the same right
2015-12-07 22:29:24	+rypervenche	Nah, I don't have any dvorak keyboards right now. I never look at my keyboard when I type. I just want to get one so that I CAN look at is and see the keys in my head a little more easily.
2015-12-07 22:29:34	+rypervenche	But I'm already at about 55wpm on Dvorak.
2015-12-07 22:34:51	psyq	that is good

2015-12-07 22:38:39	+shymega	dns was a right pain, especially when it turned out i was doing it wrong
2015-12-07 22:38:41	+shymega	plus side:
2015-12-07 22:38:46	+shymega	i now run my own mail server
2015-12-07 22:38:56	+shymega	because i lost all my emails, thankfully had backup
2015-12-07 22:39:25	+MatthewAllan93	oh ok, thats good :)
2015-12-07 22:39:41	+MatthewAllan93	got znc working properly on my centos vps now :)
2015-12-07 22:39:52	+shymega	oh, you moved distro then?
2015-12-07 22:40:08	+MatthewAllan93	yes on my vps, felt like a change haha
2015-12-07 22:40:27	+shymega	yeah.. i think i've switched distros, right, 6 times in november
2015-12-07 22:40:36	+shymega	all of which turned out to not meet my needs
2015-12-07 22:40:42	+shymega	i'm back to being a arch user \o/
2015-12-07 22:40:42	+rypervenche	shymega: I want to host my own email, but I have yet to find a good redundancy system so I can have all of my email in the right place and can still have a server down.
2015-12-07 22:40:56	+rypervenche	:O
2015-12-07 22:41:01	+rypervenche	You are not one of us!
2015-12-07 22:41:07	+shymega	rypervenche: i, err, didn't actually bother with redundancy haha
2015-12-07 22:41:13	+shymega	i use email downtime as a excuse
2015-12-07 22:41:15	+MatthewAllan93	ah ok, how do you get your domain to appear on your host name? 
2015-12-07 22:41:33	+shymega	MatthewAllan93: on the whois for irc?

2015-12-07 22:42:11	+rypervenche	shymega: My email is unfortunately important and when I miss stuff, bills don't get paid. :(
2015-12-07 22:42:25	+shymega	MatthewAllan93: oh right, yeah, bindhost on ZNC i set for that, and a A record as well
2015-12-07 22:42:31	+shymega	i think it's a reverse dns kind of thing
2015-12-07 22:42:37	+shymega	you're with gandi right, MatthewAllan93 ?
2015-12-07 22:42:51	+rypervenche	So for now I use Gandi mail, but I would love to host my own mail. I just need to find a good way to keep my mail from getting lost.
2015-12-07 22:43:04	+MatthewAllan93	shymega: ah ok makes sense, yes i am :)
2015-12-07 22:43:13	+shymega	ok

2015-12-07 22:44:08	+shymega	but say, your gandi dns goes down, really you need a slave (dunno if anyone saw that reddit post ;)) email server and dns system on another registrar, maybe rsync the email daily?
2015-12-07 22:44:27	+rypervenche	I have a few DNS slaves, so that isn't a problem.
2015-12-07 22:46:02	+MatthewAllan93	shymega: going to try it tomorrow :)
2015-12-07 22:46:43	+rypervenche	I suppose constant rsyncs could work, hmmmm.
2015-12-07 22:46:57	+rypervenche	I'd still need a second server, which I don't really feel like paying for.

2015-12-11 00:49:04	+Acou_Bass	but yeah, mint is a good distro in general... hell even the cinnamon edition would probably run on 2gb ram
2015-12-11 00:49:14	+Acou_Bass	my dad runs cinnamon on 1gb ram but hes got a dual-core intel proc
2015-12-11 00:51:06	+alexandros_c	cinnamon is light on RAM but heavy in processor use after a little load is added imho
2015-12-11 00:51:20	+Acou_Bass	yeah i think youre right there
2015-12-11 00:51:36	+Acou_Bass	but depending on what proc your wifes running 2gb ram should be abbsolutely fine for any DE you wanna run really
2015-12-11 00:51:37	+alexandros_c	I plan change from cinnamon on my nook

2015-12-13 20:20:19	Kerea	the mint team did a good job with cinnamon imo
2015-12-13 20:20:24	+shymega_	kleptos: agreed, the activity layout didn't appeal to me
2015-12-13 20:20:32	Kerea	specially once they made it independent of GNOME 3 dependencies
2015-12-13 20:20:35	+shymega_	i didn't feel like I had a lot of control over my desktop tbh
2015-12-13 20:20:43	+alexandros_c	kleptos: cinnamon is its own project now
2015-12-13 20:20:49	msjche	i never really tried KDE much, until i went to gentoo.  seems gentoo plays well with kDE
2015-12-13 20:20:56	+alexandros_c	so you don't have to feel conflicted
2015-12-13 20:20:59	Kerea	gentoo is great for KDE
2015-12-13 20:21:06	Kerea	before 5 came out, KDE on gentoo was pretty solid
2015-12-13 20:21:16	+shymega_	and the addon for Firefox to 'interface' with Gnome.org didn't appeal to me. seems to be default on fedora iirc
2015-12-13 20:21:23	+alexandros_c	cinamon is even better 
2015-12-13 20:21:24	msjche	Kerea: yup
2015-12-13 20:21:26	+shymega_	wasn't a great idea, you should at least be asked
2015-12-13 20:21:26	Kerea	right now there's a lot of collusions happening though cause i noticed frameworks and kde-base packages are mix matching
2015-12-13 20:21:36	Kerea	so it's a huge pain

2015-12-13 20:22:23	+shymega_	if someone _really_ wants to use it lol
2015-12-13 20:22:24	Kerea	although i can see KDE 5 being smoother in terms of packages and updates than Gentoo at the moment
2015-12-13 20:22:48	msjche	Kerea: shymega_ check Arch news. i'm sure someone will port to AUR tho

2015-12-13 20:39:30	msjche	thanks guys, seems to work pretty well :)
2015-12-13 20:42:47	spirou	so... Dynamic window managers "can dynamically switch between tiling or floating window layout" or  'dynamic' meaning they automatically resize and move around tiles as windows appear and disappear ?
2015-12-13 20:44:09	@Irishluck83	pretty much...the only thing in that list is i3 is a tiling...i don't think it is dynamic
2015-12-13 20:44:13	spirou	I'm mosty interested to understand what they mean with dynamic or non-dynamic when it comes to window managers
2015-12-13 20:47:24	+Acou_Bass	it says at the top that dynamc means it can do both tiling + floating
2015-12-13 20:47:26	+Acou_Bass	but uhh

2015-12-14 20:28:19	psyq	okie and how does that work?
2015-12-14 20:29:55	MatthewAllan93	buy credits using paypal or another payment system and then just create a vps with the specification and linux distrobution that you would like. then it just take the credits off as it is running
2015-12-14 20:30:02	psyq	MatthewAllan93: how did you get notification to work in i3?
2015-12-14 20:30:31	MatthewAllan93	the only thing i don't like is that you can't use a custom distro that isn't on their list like you can with vultr
2015-12-14 20:30:41	MatthewAllan93	psyq: i used dunst for notifications in i3 :)

2015-12-14 20:31:03	psyq	YES!!!! it worked
2015-12-14 20:31:03	+shymega_	i think at the end of day if you take responbillity for your actions and keep the team informed of your OS choice, what's the big issue?

2015-12-15 20:43:53	+shymega	"I am now running Arch Linux. Arch is basically the complete opposite of Ubuntu, meaning that instead of everything working out of the box and giving you tons of starter apps, nothing works out of the box and you start with nothing but a command line, and build up from there."

2015-12-15 20:55:13	@pdq	is pretty good but i prefer hover to focus and floating box style, i use devilspie2 to arrange windows per coord and pizels so no need for tiling
2015-12-15 20:55:20	@pdq	so use jwm instead now

2015-12-16 20:58:22	+rypervenche	That was a mix of Dvorak and Qwerty ><
2015-12-16 20:58:28	+rypervenche	Still getting used to this.
2015-12-16 20:58:36	+shymega	you use both now then?
2015-12-16 20:59:01	+rypervenche	Nope. Sometimes still have old tendencies.
2015-12-16 20:59:07	+shymega	i shouldn't laugh but i find the grammar and writing funny
2015-12-16 20:59:19	+shymega	the last post on that thread you linked to rypervenche 
2015-12-16 20:59:22	+rypervenche	I've been touch typing on Qwerty for a good 15+ years.
2015-12-16 20:59:38	+shymega	i've never got the hang out touch typing but people say i touch type
2015-12-16 20:59:43	+shymega	i'm adamant i don't :D
2015-12-16 21:00:12	+rypervenche	It's a bit frustrating because I can usually do a good 110wpm on qwerty, but I'm getting there on Dvorak and I'm getting faster :)
2015-12-16 21:00:15	+rypervenche	Baby steps.
2015-12-16 21:00:19	spirou_	when I type I touch the key on my querty keyboard too... touch them quite a lot. down to the bottom.

2015-12-16 21:01:18	spirou_	but I save the pinky fingers for special things

2015-12-16 21:02:27	@pdq	and going "one million dollars" and holding it coyly
2015-12-16 21:02:55	+shymega	no, no, you mean s/million/trillion/g
2015-12-16 21:03:26	spirou_	the thumbs are also quite underused... mostly just for space key I think.. and Alt and AltGr keys. I must find a way to press other keys with them too.....
2015-12-16 21:03:28	+shymega	unless you weren't referening Dr Evil
2015-12-16 21:03:54	@pdq	hehe
2015-12-16 21:06:18	spirou_	Dvorak is supposed to be optimized for english writing, right? are there other keyboard setups optimized for other languages?
2015-12-16 21:06:32	spirou_	or for programming C++
2015-12-16 21:06:54	+shymega	ah yes, C++ isn't English
2015-12-16 21:07:19	+shymega	:P iirc Dvorak was made by someone from america, but don't know if that's correct
2015-12-16 21:07:48	spirou_	{ and } are seriously horribly placed on my keyboard... AltGr-7 and AltGr-0  bahhh....
2015-12-16 21:07:58	+shymega	what keyboard/computer do you have spirou_ ?
2015-12-16 21:10:28	spirou_	KeyTronic ergoforce KT2001EPS2. just the right feeling. very simple construction inside. but should need some cleaning....
2015-12-16 21:10:50	+shymega	hmm, you mean other keyboards exist?
2015-12-16 21:10:53	+shymega	cool
2015-12-16 21:11:00	+shymega	just because, i've had this keyboard for so long now

2015-12-16 21:11:21	spirou_	will I kill some life forms if I open it and clean it?
2015-12-16 21:11:57	+shymega	yeah, but what'd they going do

2015-12-16 21:17:05	@pdq	if accumulate some can use them as currency to bet on csgo pro games or jackpot or pokewr sites
2015-12-16 21:17:13	spirou_	different skins in Minecraft can be fun, even though you normally don't see it much yourself....
2015-12-16 21:17:15	@pdq	can also sell them for real world money
2015-12-16 21:17:22	+shymega	all right, loving that

2015-12-16 21:22:26	+shymega	i've bought the triology while it was on sale, but looks like origin is actually crap
2015-12-16 21:22:35	spirou_	instead of what game?
2015-12-16 21:22:44	+shymega	sorry, instead of origin
2015-12-16 21:22:51	@pdq	ah
2015-12-16 21:22:56	+shymega	it won't even install in pol as of yet
2015-12-16 21:24:01	spirou_	aha origin is also one of those horrible "digital distribution software" things like Steam?
2015-12-16 21:24:16	+MatthewAllan93	yes it is, ea's version
2015-12-16 21:24:19	+shymega	i would say steam works better than origin, but not by a lot
2015-12-16 21:24:23	+shymega	^
2015-12-16 21:24:30	+shymega	i mean, above

2015-12-16 21:25:15	+MatthewAllan93	crysis 2 plays alright under wine though doesn't it
2015-12-16 21:25:22	+shymega	yeah, should do

2015-12-16 21:25:49	spirou_	shymega: those acroyms are contagious. U must be c4r3fu1.
2015-12-16 21:25:51	+shymega	also i heard that cryengine was going to get linux support, so maybe, just maybe, crysis 1-3 might get support too
2015-12-16 21:25:53	+MatthewAllan93	just because i have the dvd of it from a few years ago, so might install it under pol :)
2015-12-16 21:26:01	+MatthewAllan93	thats good :D

2015-12-16 21:32:13	+shymega	i don't have a mic for this PC
2015-12-16 21:32:23	+shymega	explictly disable it, i get paranoid at this moment
2015-12-16 21:32:27	spirou_	that would make the game more willing to cooperate
2015-12-16 21:32:53	spirou_	shymega: true... I don't have a mic on mine either....
2015-12-16 21:32:56	@pdq	lol
2015-12-16 21:33:35	spirou_	if I had one I would probably remove it when I'm not using it....

2015-12-16 21:39:20	+shymega	but not a human
2015-12-16 21:39:30	spirou_	there wil be no flight-permit for you. and extra papieren control when you travel by buss.
2015-12-16 21:40:36	+shymega	possibly

2015-12-16 21:40:59	+shymega	that's my keylogger's job
2015-12-16 21:41:37	spirou_	But I suppose it would be possible to have a good speech synthesis program saying random things that gets piped into the soundcard as coming from a mic that the controllers can listen to in-place?
2015-12-16 21:42:01	+shymega	seems a bit pointless to me
2015-12-16 21:42:10	+shymega	i'm not like totally avoiding surviellance
2015-12-16 21:42:37	+shymega	i use fb and twitter still, which isn't great, at the same time i have a lot of good friends who i like to keep contact with
2015-12-16 21:42:37	spirou_	yeah I guess you are still on the ok levels.... perhaps only the gray area.
2015-12-16 21:42:48	+shymega	and they couldn't give a shit or understand say, gpg

2015-12-16 21:47:23	@pdq	shymega: you should probably play deathmatch or arms race game mdoes rather than competitive as that can take 45 mins to over an hour and get punished if drop out
2015-12-16 21:47:50	@pdq	i seen you playing but then you stopped

2015-12-17 23:10:36	+shymega	but i still don't get the split of workspaces between monitors
2015-12-17 23:10:40	+shymega	why would you even ;)
2015-12-17 23:10:46	+rypervenche	shymega: What do you mean?
2015-12-17 23:11:00	+rypervenche	shymega: I am doing it right now.
2015-12-17 23:11:15	+shymega	i mean, with dwm/awesome i get a full set of tags on each mon
2015-12-17 23:11:15	+rypervenche	I have two monitors at work.
2015-12-17 23:11:24	+shymega	but with i3 you don't seem to allow that
2015-12-17 23:11:29	+rypervenche	huh?
2015-12-17 23:11:47	+alexandros_c	are you sure about that?
2015-12-17 23:11:50	+rypervenche	I put 1-8 on my left monitor and 9 and 10 on my right.
2015-12-17 23:11:59	+shymega	yeah, i get that
2015-12-17 23:12:01	+rypervenche	At my old job 1-5 were on the left and 6-10 were on the \right.
2015-12-17 23:12:05	+shymega	but i mean having 1-10 on both
2015-12-17 23:12:14	+shymega	monitors i mean
2015-12-17 23:12:16	+rypervenche	seeing the same thing on both screens?
2015-12-17 23:12:20	+shymega	no
2015-12-17 23:12:37	+shymega	with awesome or dwm, you get x number of workspaces, but each screen has it's own
2015-12-17 23:12:37	+rypervenche	Well, you could do it, but they would be a 1-10 and a 11-20
2015-12-17 23:12:44	+shymega	oh i see
2015-12-17 23:12:49	+shymega	right, back to dwm
2015-12-17 23:12:51	+shymega	;)
2015-12-17 23:12:55	+alexandros_c	lol
2015-12-17 23:13:15	+rypervenche	Because on i3 you can move the workspace across to the other screen. That would be weird in the number already existed.
2015-12-17 23:13:42	+rypervenche	And really you could name it something like 1:irc and 1:mail and they are two different workspaces.
2015-12-17 23:13:51	+shymega	oh, you allow colons
2015-12-17 23:13:54	+shymega	cool
2015-12-17 23:13:54	+rypervenche	So you could have 1-10 on both.
2015-12-17 23:13:55	+shymega	back to i3
2015-12-17 23:14:23	+rypervenche	I have some workspaces that have words in their names by default, and others that I name on the fly for whatever I'm doing.
2015-12-17 23:14:56	+rypervenche	1:irc, 2:chat, 3: web, 4:work, 10:mail. The rest I name when I use them.
2015-12-17 23:15:03	+rypervenche	no space before web
2015-12-17 23:15:05	+shymega	hmm
2015-12-17 23:15:48	psyq	it is really funny to play around with a lot of wm's 
2015-12-17 23:16:12	+rypervenche	shymega: This is my config: https://k.ryp.io/view/827bd3d3
2015-12-17 23:16:26	psyq	rypervenche: how are you able to rename the workspaces as you are going to use them?
2015-12-17 23:16:36	psyq	by editting the config file
2015-12-17 23:16:46	psyq	and reloading it ?
2015-12-17 23:16:50	+rypervenche	psyq: No, mod+shift+n
2015-12-17 23:17:13	+shymega	thanks rypervenche

2015-12-17 23:17:26	+shymega	pretty good :P
2015-12-17 23:18:13	psyq	nice what is the command for that called?
2015-12-17 23:19:46	+shymega	oh shit, i can hear my rsi arm clicking
2015-12-17 23:19:58	+shymega	damn you keyboards! damn you!
2015-12-17 23:20:09	+rypervenche	I had to add that bit, but I got it from here: http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_list_of_commands (see "6.7.2. Renaming workspaces")
2015-12-17 23:20:10	+moobot	[ i3: i3 User’s Guide ] - i3wm.org
2015-12-17 23:21:07	+rypervenche	They have all of the commands you could use and the proper bindings in their examples on that page.
2015-12-17 23:21:12	+rypervenche	It's a good read if you have some time.
2015-12-17 23:21:32	psyq	sweet I will read it 
2015-12-17 23:23:24	psyq	that is nice

2015-12-18 00:31:24	+Acou_Bass	xD

2015-12-18 21:28:38	+shymega	port forwarding would probs be good then, you could map port 4206 on the router outside to 22 on your server
2015-12-18 21:28:44	+shymega	and then keep fail2ban running
2015-12-18 21:28:47	+shymega	oh wait, ignore that

2015-12-18 21:29:56	+JayVii	atm, i'm using both, but i'll switch over to pubkey-only. i heard that's much more secure
2015-12-18 21:30:38	+shymega	much more, even better, disable root login and use the AllowUsers directive
2015-12-18 21:30:48	+JayVii	that, too
2015-12-18 21:30:50	+shymega	if you're the only user to access the server and you have sudo privs
2015-12-18 21:30:59	+shymega	it's what i always do on my public servers
2015-12-18 21:31:05	+shymega	and even laptops and desktops, i don't trust no one
2015-12-18 21:31:13	+shymega	the dog might know the password :o
2015-12-18 21:31:26	+JayVii	:O
2015-12-18 21:32:31	+JayVii	yeah, but how would i connect to it, then?
2015-12-18 21:32:42	+JayVii	i mean, i need some sort of IP/Domain
2015-12-18 21:32:53	+JayVii	public ip, that is
2015-12-18 21:33:12	+JayVii	is it enough to just open up the port in my router?
2015-12-18 21:33:17	@pdq	your external ip changes?
2015-12-18 21:34:01	+shymega	do you own a domain? you could do some kind of dynamic DNS thingajig, is dyndns still around?
2015-12-18 21:34:07	+shymega	that's the last time i did that
2015-12-18 21:34:24	+JayVii	actuallyi don't, no :/ so IP, it is

2015-12-20 16:10:03	+JayVii	ok. stupid question
2015-12-20 16:10:20	+JayVii	how is the addon able to open up the gpg-encrypted file
2015-12-20 16:10:35	+JayVii	it doesn't ask me for a password to decrypt it
2015-12-20 16:10:44	+JayVii	so what it fills in is wrong
2015-12-20 16:11:02	+Acou_Bass	0,o it should uses pinentry to ask for password xD
2015-12-20 16:11:13	+JayVii	pinentry?
2015-12-20 16:11:15	+JayVii	hm
2015-12-20 16:11:17	+shymega	if you've got gpg-agent running
2015-12-20 16:11:28	+shymega	it's gonna use that, it wouldn't just be able to access it
2015-12-20 16:12:37	+shymega	i'd be very concerned if it could decrypt it without the key... unless you don't have a passphrase for gpg
2015-12-20 16:13:15	+JayVii	it doesn't decrypt it
2015-12-20 16:13:19	+JayVii	that's why the pw is wrong
2015-12-20 16:13:26	+JayVii	but it doesn't promt me either
2015-12-20 16:13:37	+JayVii	pinetry & pinetry-gtk are installed

2015-12-20 16:14:03	+Acou_Bass	are they setup in your gpg config though
2015-12-20 16:14:08	+shymega	also, debug console might have some info

2015-12-20 16:15:27	+JayVii	wtf
2015-12-20 16:16:05	+Acou_Bass	have you decrypted your gpg stuff recently? gpg-agent might be caching your passphrase
2015-12-20 16:16:20	+shymega	it's either gpg-agent running w/ your passphrase for decryption ... or no passphrase at all for pass and it doesn't _need_ confirmation
2015-12-20 16:16:44	+Acou_Bass	yeah, i sort of wish i was lazy enough to just not use a passphrase but at the same time, muhh securitys
2015-12-20 16:17:14	+shymega	i wish you wouldn't use a passphrase Acou_Bass 
2015-12-20 16:17:22	+shymega	so i could decrypt that file in your dotfiles .mutt dir

2015-12-20 18:01:10	+JayVii	i really wanted to encrypt my HDD, but the installer doesn't support that. would be no problem. I found out how to install it manually, but their docs on that are lacking, to say the least. i think most of it got destroyed, when they moved their wiki
2015-12-20 18:01:31	+JayVii	there are a bunch of docs on exactly that, but all of them show the same page
2015-12-20 18:01:38	+JayVii	which is just a sub-topic
2015-12-20 18:01:42	+JayVii	so not useful at all
2015-12-20 18:01:57	+JayVii	but i know how to install it on zfs now
2015-12-20 18:02:02	+JayVii	great. just not useful.
2015-12-20 18:02:28	+JayVii	i may go with something else
2015-12-20 18:02:30	+JayVii	not sure
2015-12-20 18:02:57	+alexandros_c	so what are you trying to do JayVii ?
2015-12-20 18:03:13	+JayVii	installing void on a LVM encypted HDD
2015-12-20 18:03:55	+JayVii	i may just go with encrypted files -.-" not as safe as encrypted HDD's and kinda annoying as well, but this is just frustrating
2015-12-20 18:04:01	+alexandros_c	that is easy on debian, ubuntu, arch amd fedora :P
2015-12-20 18:04:22	+JayVii	i know
2015-12-20 18:04:33	+JayVii	my miniPC / server is encrypted
2015-12-20 18:04:42	+alexandros_c	I did an encrypted disk before and it was very annoying
2015-12-20 18:05:14	+JayVii	takes hours
2015-12-20 18:05:24	+alexandros_c	it is good on a server where you are not doing shutdowns and restart often or regularly 
2015-12-20 18:05:50	+JayVii	true that
2015-12-20 18:05:58	+shymega	JayVii: i found a good resource for void and encryption when i did it
2015-12-20 18:06:00	+shymega	hold on
2015-12-20 18:06:06	+JayVii	on the other hand, i have to get a keyboard everytime it reboots
2015-12-20 18:06:12	+JayVii	so every 1-2 months

2015-12-20 18:07:27	+JayVii	and the new wiki is kinda... broken on that topic

2015-12-20 20:52:14	+shymega	pretty neat, especially if you're doing a presentation or want to show a friend some awesome lisp etc
2015-12-20 20:52:33	+shymega	for HTML it shows changes when i remove <h1> for example, and renders on the fly :D
2015-12-20 20:52:36	psyq	huh lisp
2015-12-20 20:53:09	psyq	shymega: are you programming in lisp?
2015-12-20 20:54:23	+shymega	psyq, I use EmacsLISP which is a subset (and apparently better) of the LISP family. I mostly use it for configuration, but I'm exploring a wikipedia client in LISP through the API.

2015-12-20 22:28:23	+Acou_Bass	craaaaaaaaazily customized
2015-12-20 22:28:33	+Acou_Bass	i even wrote my own theme

2015-12-20 22:29:05	+Acou_Bass	well
2015-12-20 22:29:07	+Acou_Bass	sort of
2015-12-20 22:29:09	+Acou_Bass	i took the default onyx theme
2015-12-20 22:29:11	+Acou_Bass	and turned it green
2015-12-20 22:29:13	+Acou_Bass	xd
2015-12-20 22:30:05	+Acou_Bass	im just using the sable theme right now so it matches my gtk theme though

2015-12-20 22:30:52	+shymega	judging my your emotional outbursts, i'd say the ngrok thing is working

2015-12-20 22:50:15	psyq	JayVii: how do u use it?
2015-12-20 22:54:14	+JayVii	ngrok tcp -log=stdout 22 > /dev/null
2015-12-20 22:54:23	+JayVii	or, if you want to keep it open
2015-12-20 22:54:27	+JayVii	ngrok tcp 22

2015-12-21 23:13:07	+JayVii	*sigh* i gave /boot/efi 500mb... it needs 132kb

2015-12-21 23:13:17	@pdq	hehe
2015-12-21 23:13:29	+JayVii	first efi system. i didn't know what to do

2015-12-21 23:13:57	Kerea	efi is tricky to work with imo
2015-12-21 23:14:13	Kerea	my efi partion is only 128 MB
2015-12-21 23:15:14	+JayVii	see? that's more reasonable than 500MB
2015-12-21 23:15:39	+JayVii	i thought it would need as much as a normal /boot... and 100-200 MB is enough for /boot
2015-12-21 23:15:41	Kerea	i use the partion scheme layed out in the gentoo handbook
2015-12-21 23:15:45	+JayVii	well, 200mb
2015-12-21 23:15:56	Kerea	the only difference is i have a 16 GB swap instead of a 512 MB lol
2015-12-21 23:16:06	+shymega	i've got 700mb for my /boot which includes /boot/efi
2015-12-21 23:16:06	@pdq	is no real need for boot partition nowadyas anyways is there?
2015-12-21 23:16:18	+shymega	i'm just allowing space for kernels, i like to be safe :D
2015-12-21 23:16:27	Kerea	is your boot partion formated as a FAT32?
2015-12-21 23:16:40	+shymega	pdq, with EFI i believe there is for bootloaders / kernels or efi shells
2015-12-21 23:16:44	+shymega	but i'm not a experet
2015-12-21 23:16:48	+shymega	even in spelling
2015-12-21 23:17:02	+JayVii	my server has 4GB RAM, but i only gave it 1GB swap, instead of 8GB. i won't use hibernate and it's just so the system won't kill itself if 4GB are used
2015-12-21 23:17:11	Kerea	if your boot partion wasn't formated as a vfat 32 then EFI won't work
2015-12-21 23:17:35	c_smith	talking about UEFI?
2015-12-21 23:17:43	+JayVii	just EFI
2015-12-21 23:17:48	c_smith	ah.
2015-12-21 23:17:51	Kerea	technically they're the same thing
2015-12-21 23:17:53	+JayVii	at least, that's what lsblk says
2015-12-21 23:17:54	Kerea	the U just means Universal

2015-12-21 23:18:16	+JayVii	i have an encrypted swap space :P
2015-12-21 23:18:19	+JayVii	hehe
2015-12-21 23:18:19	c_smith	I'll say this: 512 MB for the EFI partition is usually much more than is needed but gives plenty of room to stretch out
2015-12-21 23:18:28	Kerea	^^
2015-12-21 23:18:31	McClane2	:-)
2015-12-21 23:18:38	Kerea	mines only 128 MB, but it has to be formatted as a FAT32
2015-12-21 23:18:43	c_smith	I rarely go above 100MB used
2015-12-21 23:18:43	+JayVii	key-encryption. it will randomly assign a new one after each boot
2015-12-21 23:18:51	+JayVii	so all data is lost after each boot
2015-12-21 23:19:07	+JayVii	hibernation wouldn't work anyway
2015-12-21 23:19:11	c_smith	but the 512 is just for convenience for me, and it's a nice, round number. XD
2015-12-21 23:19:28	Kerea	yes gotta love that base 2

You can continue and go through your Discovery Queue two more times each day to get a maximum of three card drops each day. (If you reach Steam Level 5 before the end of the sale, you’ll be granted the cards you earned by exploring your Steam
2015-12-22 20:25:27	@pdq	Discovery Queue during the sale).

2015-12-22 22:08:24	@pdq	psyq: havign issues with it?
2015-12-22 22:08:33	spirou_	something with simple file burning (so no stupid music or video stuff) that counts how many MB's it is while you drag in the files, so I can easily fill upp the 4483MB a disk have.
2015-12-22 22:08:55	psyq	yeah the fusion addon doesn't seem to work like before
2015-12-22 22:09:32	spirou_	shymega: and something that is not KDE yeah.... all those libraries it is gonna fill my system with is scary :-D
2015-12-22 22:11:54	spirou_	and yeah it must need 4483MB free on the disk for some image it then burns from. it must be capable to read the files directly while it burn.

2015-12-28 21:01:34	+alexandros_c	MatthewAllan93: can you use void with a uefi system?
2015-12-28 21:01:35	spirou	I just use Transmission, but I would prefer the userinterface from an older version.....
2015-12-28 21:02:13	+MatthewAllan93	i think i am going to stick with i3wm for a while because i always try out differnt window managers and always come back to i3wm because of how i set it out and everything just suits how i work haha :)
2015-12-28 21:02:17	spirou	so if someone could combine transmission from today with one from five years ago, I would be happy
2015-12-28 21:02:29	+MatthewAllan93	alexandros_c: yes you can, there is a article on their wiki about it, i think :)
2015-12-28 21:02:35	+MatthewAllan93	let me find the link :)
2015-12-28 21:02:50	+alexandros_c	thanks

2015-12-29 21:44:54	@pdq	white page/error looks like
2015-12-29 21:45:19	__shymega__	oh bugger
2015-12-29 21:45:22	__shymega__	that should be locked down

2015-12-29 21:45:58	@pdq	well is not error_reporting or diplay_errors i can see is just a white page
2015-12-29 21:46:06	@pdq	okie
2015-12-29 21:46:50	__shymega__	hmm, yeah iptables should restrict access to the services i'm configuring to my IP only
2015-12-29 21:46:54	__shymega__	so maybe that's normal
2015-12-29 21:47:07	__shymega__	pdq, if you don't mind could you do telnet shymega.org.uk 80 ?
2015-12-29 21:47:24	__shymega__	or i could do it else where, but i don't like those online pen testing sites
2015-12-29 21:47:59	@pdq	not respondign loosk like
2015-12-29 21:48:13	__shymega__	great!
2015-12-29 21:48:16	__shymega__	cheers, iptables was right
2015-12-29 21:48:47	__shymega__	it's only because i can't be arsed to ssh tunnel my services over to me, and they are unsecure at the moment, it's nice to test it on isolation
2015-12-29 21:48:57	__shymega__	provided there's no hackers on my network, but oh wait
2015-12-29 21:48:58	__shymega__	:P
2015-12-29 21:49:08	__shymega__	anyway the risk is smaller

2015-12-30 00:38:54	JayVii	which folder did you create the symlink of?

2016-01-02 17:28:24	Malsasa	MatthewAllan93: can you give me your opinion? If it is true that OOXML is open and documented, why does TDF face many bugs in DOCX/XLSX file handling? I've read https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/LibreOffice_OOXML but truly I still don't understand why.

2016-01-02 17:29:35	shymega__	or have i misinterpreted what you said? :|
2016-01-02 17:31:12	+MatthewAllan93	Malsasa: I would have said the same thing as shymega__ because if someone opens a document in office that has been edited in libreoffice, there will be changes that are not carried over and so the other indivudal using Microsoft Office can't see all of the changes
2016-01-02 17:31:15	Malsasa	shymega__: can I ask you your opinion? What is the main difficulty in OOXML file handling? Software patents, 6000 pages documentation, proprietary rendering engine, or times?
2016-01-02 17:32:16	shymega__	Malsasa, I don't actually use Office programs.. I do things in LaTeX :D

2016-01-02 20:19:25	+shymega	has anyone forced firefox to use desktop view of a site?
2016-01-02 20:19:33	+shymega	sites keep thinking i'm a mobile user :D
2016-01-02 20:19:47	+shymega	presumably because of my tiling WM, it probably makes the screen size smaller
2016-01-02 20:20:49	+JayVii	well, push the FF window on a bigger screen
2016-01-02 20:20:53	Santo_101	happy flew year peepz =)
2016-01-02 20:20:53	+JayVii	and check your useragent
2016-01-02 20:21:31	+JayVii	not bigger screen
2016-01-02 20:21:44	+JayVii	i mean, push it on a workspace, where it sits alone
2016-01-02 20:21:54	+MatthewAllan93	Hey Santo_101 :), Happy New Year :)
2016-01-02 20:22:04	+shymega	yeah, my issue is that i like to have say, emacs or rxvt side by side with firefox
2016-01-02 20:22:09	+shymega	but i'll try forcing a useragent
2016-01-02 20:22:11	+shymega	thanks
2016-01-02 20:22:14	Santo_101	we've survived this time too i hope??
2016-01-02 20:22:25	@pdq	hny Santo_101 
2016-01-02 20:23:22	Santo_101	pdq our arch wiki. *bows*
2016-01-02 20:26:03	+JayVii	well, another solution would be to have one on top, the other one on the bottom
2016-01-02 20:26:35	+JayVii	or buy a bigger screen
2016-01-02 20:26:52	+JayVii	:D
2016-01-02 20:26:56	McClane2	^_^
2016-01-02 20:27:02	+shymega	haven't got the money, anyway this 1920x1080 has served me well - i think it's more the fault of the web devs for assuming it's a mobile
2016-01-02 20:27:08	+shymega	we'll see if user-agent fixes it anyway
2016-01-02 20:28:33	+shymega	oh no
2016-01-02 20:28:36	+shymega	i have to reboot firefox
2016-01-02 20:28:42	+shymega	but i've got history from december 2015
2016-01-02 20:28:46	+shymega	it's like a trophy
2016-01-02 20:29:57	+JayVii	don't delete that history then :P

2016-01-02 20:49:15	+shymega	will mention it to them

2016-01-02 20:49:42	+Piece_Maker	i know some modern sites are 'responsive' ie. they automagically switch depending on window size... but i didnt think a desktop browser  would shrink small enough for it to happen
2016-01-02 20:49:43	+Piece_Maker	XD
2016-01-02 20:50:03	+shymega	i don't like it when the viewer doesn't have control over the site's functions

2016-01-04 23:33:37	psyq	hi spirou. It is fine on all fronts just one little problem with getting my terminal to use the dejavu Sans for powerline
2016-01-04 23:34:46	spirou	Where is the guide "How to switch from LinuxMint17.1/Mate to Void, while keeping all your files and settings, in three easy steps". I must have missed it?
2016-01-04 23:35:45	psyq	have no idea 
2016-01-04 23:36:13	spirou	what is "powerline" ?
2016-01-04 23:37:10	psyq	powerline is an oh-my-zsh theme where it uses some special characters
2016-01-04 23:37:17	spirou	and yeah I guess such a guide have yet to be written :D
2016-01-04 23:37:35	spirou	aha ok
2016-01-04 23:38:57	psyq	yeah I think so
2016-01-04 23:39:40	spirou	I should try zsh. sounds like the thing where all terminal use improvements goes.
2016-01-04 23:41:11	spirou	are there things in bash that is missing in zsh?
2016-01-04 23:48:01	psyq	not that I know of

2016-01-05 20:24:46	+shymega	xb
2016-01-05 20:24:52	+shymega	C-x b
2016-01-05 20:26:46	psyq	hi guys

2016-01-05 20:29:32	_Kai_	Python 2.7.6 (default, Jun 22 2015, 17:58:13) shymega
2016-01-05 20:29:40	+MatthewAllan93	Hey psyq :)
2016-01-05 20:31:15	+shymega	ok, thanks _Kai_ 
2016-01-05 20:31:40	+shymega	gimme a sec pls
2016-01-05 20:32:27	+shymega	nevermind my theory that it might be py2.7
2016-01-05 20:32:41	+shymega	did you install it with --user?
2016-01-05 20:33:29	+shymega	i think it might need to be global, OR, you could clone this repo https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt , and run ./lets-encrypt-auto in a virtualenv
2016-01-05 20:33:30	+moobot	[ letsencrypt/letsencrypt · GitHub ] - github.com
2016-01-05 20:33:50	+shymega	thing is, i don't know much about Ubuntu, I prefer arch etc... that and I've pretended Ubuntu doesn't exist since Unity :P
2016-01-05 20:35:59	_Kai_	I cloned that repo when folllowing this guide shymega: https://letsencrypt.org/howitworks/

2016-01-05 20:36:38	+shymega	yeah, virtualenv... i'm not really sure how to go about fixing this to be honest
2016-01-05 20:38:41	+rypervenche	_Kai_:  I use letsencrypt too :) Weee
2016-01-05 20:39:10	+rypervenche	sudo and being root are different...
2016-01-05 20:39:37	+shymega	well, i meant it as they equate to the same end result
2016-01-05 20:39:46	+shymega	if that makes sense
2016-01-05 20:40:13	+shymega	so, sudo touch /etc/nginx/nginx.conf would equate to the same thing, as with # touch /etc/nginx/nginx.touch
2016-01-05 20:40:17	+shymega	esp. with permissions
2016-01-05 20:40:47	+rypervenche	shymega: In that case, yes. But things that rely on environment variables and thing of that nature will be different.
2016-01-05 20:40:57	+shymega	oh yeah, indeed, forgot about that

2016-01-05 20:43:58	_Kai_	thought so kk

2016-01-05 20:51:20	+rypervenche	_Kai_: Looks to be an issue with your version of python
2016-01-05 20:51:35	_Kai_	rypervenche: you sure. it's the defualt version on 14.04?
2016-01-05 20:51:45	+rypervenche	_Kai_: That link shows so. Maybe we can change to python3. Let me do a little digging.
2016-01-05 20:51:48	psyq	I am good MatthewAllan93 I got i3 like I want it and now I can manage my servers as well

2016-01-05 20:55:15	_Kai_	tried sudo apt-get install libffi-dev --reinstall as it was suggested that it may be the issue in the comments of that DO
2016-01-05 20:55:51	_Kai_	I needed to update python's ssl libraries:
2016-01-05 20:55:51	_Kai_	apt-get install python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
2016-01-05 20:55:51	_Kai_	apt-get install python-pip

2016-01-05 20:55:52	_Kai_	Then I needed to import ssl into python.
2016-01-05 20:55:54	_Kai_	python
2016-01-05 20:55:57	_Kai_	import ssl
2016-01-05 20:55:58	psyq	MatthewAllan93: I am still trying to get the powerline font to work

2016-01-05 20:57:47	+rypervenche	_Kai_: The problem still seems to stem from your version being slightly older that what is needed.
2016-01-05 20:58:48	+rypervenche	The problem seems to have been fixed in a slightly newer sub-version.
2016-01-05 20:58:55	+rypervenche	2.7.9
2016-01-05 20:59:09	psyq	it is still not working and it is annouying really

2016-01-05 21:07:54	+rypervenche	I have the beard now :)
2016-01-05 21:07:57	+shymega	woah, solaris is still around? other than say opensolaris 
2016-01-05 21:08:02	+rypervenche	But some of them do.
2016-01-05 21:08:15	_Kai_	shymega: yep
2016-01-05 21:08:19	+rypervenche	It's an old version of Solaris. So....yeah. And they don't want to change that.

2016-01-05 22:36:53	_Kai_	do poke me with a stick in query if there's a mistake or whatever there
2016-01-05 22:36:58	_Kai_	I really should add comments to my blog
2016-01-05 22:37:29	_Kai_	not sure what platform to use.  Not a fan of Discourse (or whatever the comments platform ppl use it called) cause it doesn't delete acocunts well (and well it's yet another account)
2016-01-05 22:37:48	_Kai_	might do google comments but I move google accounts from time to time so replying then eh
2016-01-05 22:37:52	_Kai_	facebook is too personal for people I'd think
2016-01-05 22:38:11	_Kai_	do you have comments on your site MatthewAllan93?
2016-01-05 22:38:42	+MatthewAllan93	I used to use disqus because it intergrated with hugo and my theme but i turned them off for now.
2016-01-05 22:38:50	_Kai_	disqus that's it
2016-01-05 22:38:50	McClane2	Looks like he got hit by mattress and nto truck.
2016-01-05 22:38:53	_Kai_	how do you like disqus?
2016-01-05 22:39:20	+MatthewAllan93	It's alright but I would rather use a open source commenting system.
2016-01-05 22:42:32	+shymega	yup
2016-01-05 22:42:36	+shymega	much better open source imo
2016-01-05 22:42:48	_Kai_	any you suggest MatthewAllan93 shymega?
2016-01-05 22:43:00	+shymega	don't know of any tbh
2016-01-05 22:43:10	+MatthewAllan93	Me neither
2016-01-05 22:43:20	_Kai_	well then
2016-01-05 22:43:26	_Kai_	google comments it'll probably end up being lol
2016-01-05 22:43:35	_Kai_	more people have a google plus than a disqus anyway
2016-01-05 22:43:41	_Kai_	mostly cause Google forces google plus down your throat
2016-01-05 22:43:44	_Kai_	because fuck you and choice
2016-01-05 22:44:06	+rypervenche	Pretty much.
2016-01-05 22:46:58	_Kai_	google are very anti open source and anti choice recently
2016-01-05 22:47:06	_Kai_	Can you imagine the outrage if Microsoft made Edgebooks?
2016-01-05 22:47:13	_Kai_	cause all Chromebooks are is the biggest lock in in the indsutry
2016-01-05 22:47:40	_Kai_	google has even pushed updates to them which breaks linux dual boots.

2016-01-05 23:22:07	_Kai_	spirou: virtual private server
2016-01-05 23:22:15	spirou	ah
2016-01-05 23:23:07	_Kai_	spirou: think a small server hosted in the 'cloud' (aka: someone elses computer) rather than your own
2016-01-05 23:23:21	+MatthewAllan93	Thanks for the details _Kai_, I will try to join tomorrow because I am going to sleep now.
2016-01-05 23:23:29	+MatthewAllan93	Speak to you all tomorrow :).
2016-01-05 23:24:28	spirou	do they allow anything be running on that virtual machine, or lots of limits (beside bandwitdh and diskspace and memory and ...) ?
2016-01-05 23:24:33	_Kai_	night MatthewAllan93
2016-01-05 23:24:42	_Kai_	spirou: as long as it's legal you should be fine
2016-01-05 23:24:51	_Kai_	you can't host priated content and that sort of stuff 
2016-01-05 23:25:05	spirou	that is, it must be legal in usa then.
2016-01-05 23:25:08	_Kai_	If I have something interfacing with the public net it's nice to have it on a VPS rather than your home connection (harder to DOX harder to DDOS)
2016-01-05 23:25:11	_Kai_	spirou: well not quite
2016-01-05 23:25:31	_Kai_	obviously a lot of these cloud providers are US based (though they're losing ground to some European companies due to Snowdon revelations)
2016-01-05 23:25:36	_Kai_	but it'd depend where your data is located
2016-01-05 23:25:54	_Kai_	but yeah if it breaks US law it's bound to break laws elsewhere too.
2016-01-05 23:25:56	_Kai_	can't reaely think of an example
2016-01-05 23:26:15	_Kai_	US law is just based on Britain law which is basically similar to what most of Europe uses
2016-01-05 23:26:25	spirou	so I can make a webpage that say that Erdogan is stupid, but can't link to a site that indexes other sites that have files that contain checksums of copies of movies  :D
2016-01-05 23:26:38	_Kai_	oh you can link to torrent sites sure
2016-01-05 23:26:47	_Kai_	I'd expect that to be fine

2016-01-06 00:53:03	c_smith	anyone have any insight on to what might cause a znc server to suddenly not find almost all the valid freenode servers?
2016-01-06 00:53:05	+kleptos	_Kai_: niice.. now I feel even more like a sucker
2016-01-06 00:53:31	_Kai_	kleptos: to be fair
2016-01-06 00:53:37	c_smith	I've only been able to get it to see irc.freenode.net (which I don't think is an actual server)
2016-01-06 00:53:39	_Kai_	they're a kickstarter you could back
2016-01-06 00:53:42	_Kai_	seem reliable
2016-01-06 00:53:53	_Kai_	so it's a shame that it worked out like that
2016-01-06 00:54:01	_Kai_	kleptos: how much was it?
2016-01-06 00:54:31	+kleptos	there have been many kick starters that were nothing but vapor

2016-01-06 00:58:12	_Kai_	Thunderfood did a good video disproving it point after point c_smith kleptos
2016-01-06 00:58:16	_Kai_	basically it's all ballocks
2016-01-06 00:58:23	_Kai_	can't even driver over it since it'll smooth over in no time
2016-01-06 00:58:52	_Kai_	that's even if you can pay up enough to get a significant amount of them
2016-01-06 00:58:58	_Kai_	and they are inefficient since they are on the gorund
2016-01-06 00:59:03	_Kai_	it'd be better to have them ABOVE the roads

2016-01-07 22:51:55	+shymega	any editor is good, as long as you can do things and you're happy doing it, so what? I don't care if you use nano :D
2016-01-07 22:52:18	+shymega	pdq, try the Prelude emacs config / Spacemacs / emacs-starter-kit if you want
2016-01-07 22:52:20	+shymega	not pdq
2016-01-07 22:52:23	+shymega	ignore that
2016-01-07 22:52:26	+shymega	i mean psyq

2016-01-07 22:52:57	+rypervenche	hahaha
2016-01-07 22:54:16	psyq	I will try any editor just to see if I like it or not

2016-01-07 22:54:42	psyq	now not so much
2016-01-07 22:55:08	+shymega	in terms of keybindings nano is akin to Emacs, e.g C-x C-c
2016-01-07 22:55:09	+shymega	i think
2016-01-07 22:55:24	psyq	okie
2016-01-07 22:55:50	psyq	but in emacs you can make key sequences right
2016-01-07 22:55:51	+shymega	there's tons of ways to edit out there, try them all muhaha! You've only got what, 8 months left?

2016-01-07 23:04:39	in1t3r	shymega, you are still in timeout
2016-01-07 23:04:40	+shymega	but we'll see, it'd be interesting to see the logs

2016-01-10 22:26:31	psyq	I think so it is challenging me enough hehehe
2016-01-10 22:26:40	@Irishluck83	that is why i moved to it
2016-01-10 22:26:45	@Irishluck83	i3 is pretty simple
2016-01-10 22:27:01	psyq	and I think it is nice to learn haskell as well
2016-01-10 22:27:25	@Irishluck83	yea
2016-01-10 22:29:20	+Acou_Bass	ive never really tried xmonad at all... what can it do that awesome cant?
2016-01-10 22:29:27	+Acou_Bass	(besides be programmed in haskell) XD
2016-01-10 22:29:43	psyq	one of my coworkers told me to give haskell a shot
2016-01-10 22:30:17	psyq	Acou_Bass: basically it can the same it is just programmed in haskell instead of luakit
2016-01-10 22:30:23	+Acou_Bass	hmm
2016-01-10 22:30:24	psyq	lua i mean
2016-01-10 22:31:21	psyq	I like AWESOME too and I like that you have that customizablity in Awesome that you have but I just hate lua
2016-01-10 22:31:46	+Acou_Bass	xD
2016-01-10 22:32:05	+Acou_Bass	i have no preference towards either because im not a programmer... i just use whatever the WM asks me to use and dont question it

2016-01-10 22:48:06	@Irishluck83	which onedid youlike
2016-01-10 22:48:27	c_smith	Irishluck83, I'm partial to both i3 and awesome
2016-01-10 22:48:37	c_smith	but I can't decide. XD
2016-01-10 22:48:57	+shymega	c_smith, more viable?
2016-01-10 22:49:05	@Irishluck83	i3 is simple but u can configure awesome more
2016-01-10 22:49:19	+shymega	should viability really matter? I mean to say, I thought Arch was fairly flexible
2016-01-10 22:49:29	c_smith	shymega, as in, which would you recommend
2016-01-10 22:49:44	c_smith	viable prolly wasn't the right word. XD

2016-01-10 23:13:01	FXpr0	hey ummm, can I get some help please?
2016-01-10 23:15:06	+shymega	what with?
2016-01-10 23:15:18	@Irishluck83	sure
2016-01-10 23:16:02	FXpr0	first is imgur.com the way to go on linux for uploading screen shots and posting links?
2016-01-10 23:16:12	c_smith	Irishluck83, that screenshot, isn't it i3?
2016-01-10 23:16:21	FXpr0	like on windows I use jetscreenshot.com's program
2016-01-10 23:16:44	+shymega	FXpr0, it's not the way to go as such, it's really just the submitter's choice. Some people host their own images for example
2016-01-10 23:17:00	+shymega	But I'll concede that it is quite common.
2016-01-10 23:17:02	FXpr0	ok so what is a good program for that on debian?
2016-01-10 23:17:29	c_smith	FXpr0, also, some choose to use imgbin, or some other sites
2016-01-10 23:17:56	c_smith	FXpr0, just take a screenshot with the print screen key and upload the resulting image
2016-01-10 23:18:22	c_smith	ofc, that functionality differs with the DE, so I should ask, what DE?
2016-01-10 23:18:47	FXpr0	jetscreenshot you just click an icon, it gives the selection box, you can swip your image and then do basic edit add txt etc, and upload to internet or save to hd then post a link to whoever you are explaining something to.
2016-01-10 23:19:50	c_smith	FXpr0, afaik there exists for Linux, don't quote me though
2016-01-10 23:20:37	FXpr0	xchat is a good bit better than what I use on windows 7 which I normally use mIRC
2016-01-10 23:20:53	+shymega	jetscreenshot isn't for linux apparently
2016-01-10 23:20:57	+shymega	but there's alternatives
2016-01-10 23:21:02		[psyq back: gone 00:47:02]
2016-01-10 23:21:12	+shymega	it looks clickbaity - is that even an adjective yet? :P
2016-01-10 23:21:14	FXpr0	any recommendations by chance?  just simple and effective is all I want.
2016-01-10 23:21:24	+shymega	shutter?
2016-01-10 23:21:26	+shymega	that's a good one
2016-01-10 23:21:49	psyq	Irishluck83: yes that is what I did
2016-01-10 23:22:57	@Irishluck83	i didnt work for me
2016-01-10 23:23:47	@Irishluck83	so i re-did my bar...if you look at the link
2016-01-10 23:23:53	@pdq	yep shutter is good
2016-01-10 23:24:04	FXpr0	ok shutter is already installed good.
2016-01-10 23:26:19	c_smith	FXpr0, and then with most DEs, there's at least something mapped to take a screenshot with print screen
2016-01-10 23:27:32	psyq	that looks much better
2016-01-10 23:27:41	psyq	how did you make it like that?

2016-01-12 20:49:52	+shymega	i was sending a email to someone after i got GNUS reconfigured and working
2016-01-12 20:50:16	+shymega	so I figured I'd check with them if they could see the email User-Agent header, couldn't see it on their copy of my test email at all
2016-01-12 20:50:50	+shymega	turned out that I've put a setting on my postfix server that strips information like that in the name of privacy, and i'd named the config file in a manner it was literally hidden
2016-01-12 20:51:04	@pdq	ah
2016-01-12 20:51:22	+shymega	either way this happens a lot

2016-01-12 20:52:48	+shymega	downside of when mysqld is offline
2016-01-12 20:53:01	+shymega	my setup uses mysql to understand users etc

2016-01-12 20:53:23	+shymega	looked like a memory overflow

2016-01-12 20:53:52	+shymega	mysql has so many settings though
2016-01-12 20:54:10	+shymega	and i don't recall changing anything :|
2016-01-12 20:54:37	+shymega	probably just a fluke, even though the server's got 1024 RAM, and it was well under 750MB when i checked
2016-01-12 20:54:49	@pdq	has any swap
2016-01-12 20:54:52	@pdq	?

2016-01-12 21:00:10	psyq	what are u reasons that a RedHat that is intergrated with Active Directory looses the connect to the AD what should I do?

2016-01-12 21:12:08	+shymega	even more worrying, firmware level, like Intel Remote Managment for their chips

2016-01-12 21:14:18	McClane2	I'd be able to obtain good system software free, just fixed error causing mcclane2 to a 50 second delay when speaking.
2016-01-12 21:14:24	+shymega	i still can't pin down the issue :/
2016-01-12 21:14:41	+shymega	although one of my theories is a race condition effect
2016-01-12 21:15:04	+shymega	my laptop and desktop are both set to sync email every 3 minutes, and they use NTP. So in theory there might be a problem then

2016-01-13 21:51:28	+shymega	oh yeah
2016-01-13 21:51:29	+Acou_Bass	you just do crontab as user instead of as sudo

2016-01-13 22:32:16	+Acou_Bass	things like HTTPS rely on the time between the two computers being in sync

2016-01-13 22:33:40	spirou	so if a users clock is say five minutes wrong, he could get a cert error visiting a page sometimes?
2016-01-13 22:33:54	+Acou_Bass	i would assume so yeah
2016-01-13 22:34:01	+Acou_Bass	i think theres a few other things that rely on it too
2016-01-13 22:35:49	spirou	hmm... my clock says it is 21:35 (UTC) right now. I hope that is exact enough
2016-01-13 22:36:48	spirou	it would be interesting to learn more about the time need for https.

2016-01-13 22:45:44	spirou	I think I'm quite happy that my computer clock is exact to the minute. or give or take a few minutes.
2016-01-13 22:46:01	@pdq	:o
2016-01-13 22:46:12	@pdq	why would it be so out of sync
2016-01-13 22:46:23	psyq	pdq: Exchange Server is a Windows Emailing server that most corporates use
2016-01-13 22:47:04	spirou	if programs are sensitive, couldn't they be adjusted to accept somewhat more time difference?
2016-01-13 22:48:07	@pdq	imo if a computer should do one thing correct, time should be it hehe
2016-01-13 22:48:10	@pdq	very simple
2016-01-13 22:48:16	@pdq	and also time is used alot
2016-01-13 22:48:28	@pdq	even though is mainlyh counting time from start of unixtime
2016-01-13 22:50:18	spirou	But I certainly don't want my computer to have to contact a time server all the time. Sure, once every two years or so would be ok.
2016-01-13 22:51:39	spirou	or maybe the repository could mention the current time when you contact it anyway, so the clock is not completly off.
2016-01-13 22:53:58	spirou	btw, how come computers clocks always go correct (despite no time server syncing), but home routers are so horrible at it? 
2016-01-13 22:54:52	spirou	All home routers I have fiddled with have a internal clock that is a few minutes wrong already after an hour.
2016-01-13 22:56:30	@pdq	use your distros time servers and do it when you update or install package?
2016-01-13 22:56:49	@pdq	every distro has their own ntp and can also set up your own for provacy
2016-01-13 22:56:54	@pdq	privacy
2016-01-13 22:57:31	@pdq	routers are much simpler i guess
2016-01-13 22:58:22	spirou	but making a clock that go right (or a few seconds wrong per year) is so cheap and easy... :-/ 
2016-01-13 22:58:30	@pdq	lol
2016-01-13 22:58:31	spirou	I guess home routers are cheaper than that.
2016-01-13 22:58:45	@pdq	i've never noticed
2016-01-13 22:59:40	spirou	yeah normally you never notice. it doesn't use the time for anything other than stamping its internal log (if you turn that on).
2016-01-13 23:04:56	@pdq	psyq: i dunno much about that stuff but it looks like you're able to, i'm not sure exactly how though

2016-01-14 22:52:47	⚡	spirou should make a video player called electronic-media-access-computer-system
2016-01-14 22:53:52	spirou	wouldn't you be biased against editors compared to other kinds of programs, like games?
2016-01-14 22:54:00	+shymega	don't question my logic
2016-01-14 22:54:08	+shymega	for i am a god with LISP

2016-01-14 22:54:54	+shymega	the first iteration made more sense to be honest.
2016-01-14 22:56:26	spirou	should I do something creative tonight, or surf webcomics, or making a backup?
2016-01-14 22:56:42	+JayVii	question remains... Slackware 14.1 or SLackware-Current
2016-01-14 22:56:54	+JayVii	i may go with current, until 14.2 comes out
2016-01-14 22:57:57	+shymega	.8 should spirou do a XKCD marathon?
2016-01-14 22:57:57	+moobot	Ask again later
2016-01-14 22:58:00	+shymega	ok
2016-01-14 22:58:02	+shymega	.8 should spirou do a XKCD marathon?

2016-01-14 22:58:21	+JayVii	i like how the menu-item "Propaganda" on the slackware website links to this http://www.slackware.com/~msimons/slackware/grfx/

2016-01-14 22:58:23	+shymega	yeah, figures
2016-01-14 22:58:50	+JayVii	also, i like the "SLACK OFF." banner
2016-01-14 22:59:19	+JayVii	did you know, that slackware skipped a version number once?
2016-01-14 22:59:47	+shymega	so did Emacs
2016-01-14 22:59:53	+shymega	not that I'm going on about it
2016-01-14 22:59:55	+JayVii	their explaination was, that their release numbers were lower than those of other distros. so they skipped one to appear more advanced

2016-01-14 23:46:07	+JayVii	well, nobody knows. i don't really care, though
2016-01-14 23:46:42	+JayVii	he got me into linux and i ment some pretty cool people over there, that i am still in touch with

2016-01-15 21:46:47	psyq	what destros does gandi offer

2016-01-15 21:47:21	+shymega	in fact, i'm not even sure where to look now
2016-01-15 21:47:34	+MatthewAllan93	psyq: Yes what shymega said but also Arch Linux and a few others. I think they are also including freebsd soon.
2016-01-15 21:47:38	psyq	debian if fine

2016-01-15 21:54:32	+shymega	sure
2016-01-15 21:54:33	_Kai_	much eaiser then dealing with annoying certs
2016-01-15 21:55:37	_Kai_	shymega: what do you need on EC2 that DO doesn't offer though?
2016-01-15 21:55:49	_Kai_	I like the way DO looks and works + the way they handle domains
2016-01-15 21:55:57	_Kai_	yeah it's simplified but that's nice.
2016-01-15 21:56:09	_Kai_	I do most of what I want in the OS anyway
2016-01-15 21:56:13	McClane2	I already have one of those.

2016-01-15 21:58:05	McClane2	r installing linux is always satisfying. Like snickers.
2016-01-15 21:58:11	+shymega	I barely get that with DO, and I like scalabillity
2016-01-15 21:58:20	+shymega	EC2 feels better for my inner control freak
2016-01-15 21:58:20	_Kai_	fair enough
2016-01-15 21:58:54	_Kai_	be nice if they had a simplified UI though (with an 'advanced' option)
2016-01-15 21:58:57	_Kai_	but we know where that leads...
2016-01-15 21:59:05	+shymega	hell?

2016-01-16 00:21:08	DQSII	well like i disagree i think 10 is a major improvment upon 7 and 8 and so what if they spy old news microsofts been spying since windows 95
2016-01-16 00:21:11	@pdq	maybe if close the windows will be hotter in there then cpu will boot faster, i don't think makes much difference here with windows open or closed

2016-01-16 14:31:56	+shymega	tempted to pirate it, i think my ISO might be missing things
2016-01-16 14:32:13	+shymega	which is a bugger
2016-01-16 14:34:15	psyq	hi guys
2016-01-16 14:35:22	+shymega	still, the license i'm looking at is normally 43 quid
2016-01-16 14:35:26	+shymega	and now it's 19.49 quid
2016-01-16 14:35:37	+shymega	so i guess that's a better deal than usual
2016-01-16 14:35:51	+Acou_Bass	reactOS need to up their game so people like you dont need to give MS money
2016-01-16 14:36:11	+shymega	indeed
2016-01-16 14:36:30	+shymega	pirating is a dodgy option for my situtation, as i live w/ family
2016-01-16 14:36:33	+shymega	and use their internet
