2015-11-07 20:35:43	bitlord	David________, as I told you before, dnf repolist, see what else you have enabled, there is a dnf  plugin which handles enabling/disabling repos too (config ...) you can use it to disable those extra repos, then use   package-cleanup  from yum-utils to see all orphan packages, remove them (also be careful about this), remove third party repo files completely from /etc/yum.repos.d/  and install ones you want and which are compatible   (example for
2015-11-07 20:35:44	bitlord	enabling disabling repos  https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/22/html/System_Administrators_Guide/sec-Managing_DNF_Repositories.html  )

2015-11-07 20:58:52	David________	bitlord, the issue is not with dnf. It's with VirtualBox not loading a virtual machine.
2015-11-07 20:59:13	pwlandoll	bitlord, I'm rather new to Fedora. Does RPMFusion typically fix this kind of thing quickly, or should I use an older kernel or build the module myself?
2015-11-07 21:00:34	bitlord	pwlandoll, don't know, I don't use/need out-of-tree modules, it will probably get fixed soon (if no one cares about that driver it won't be in rpmfusion)
2015-11-07 21:01:02	otjura	fedora doesn't "fix" things by patching them to work with some software, it fixes things by waiting that upstream fixes those (meaning either kernel or whatever software you are having troubles with)
2015-11-07 21:01:50	bitlord	David________, not sure how it is done with virtualbox repo ..., it needs to build a kernel modules (if I remember correctly) and load it, possibly some service is installed and you need to run it (it is probably enabled by default when you install it, but maybe it will run at next boot)
2015-11-07 21:02:16	otjura	this is 99% pure upstream based distro pwlandoll

2015-11-07 21:03:27	bitlord	David________, on the virtualbox website it mentions 'dkms'  for fedora/mandriva  weird (maybe that is how it works, but I guess fedora equivalent for it is kmod/akmod, maybe oracle don't use that)

2015-11-07 21:07:20	bitlord	David________, yes, dkms is a tool which automatically checks and builds kernel modules for currently running kernel, but if it is available on fedora maybe it works, fedora mostly uses akmods which is similar tool

2015-11-08 15:52:40	Khaytsus	zoldyck: but anyway, what I personally do is open ssh in the firewall to my shells, my cellphone provider, work, etc....  at worst I ssh into one of my shells and ssh in from there if I'm somewhere else.

2015-11-08 15:58:12	Khaytsus	zoldyck: IMO it works much better.  Yes you may open it up to millions IPs but you're blocking billions ;)  Top pri is always security, so make sure root isn't allowed on ssh and use good passwords.  From there you're just making things quieter in logs
2015-11-08 15:58:40	Khaytsus	linuxmodder: Cool, now I know..  Workstation Netinst does let you pick the DE.  For some reason I thought that option was completely gone now.

2015-11-08 20:21:18	theor	and the only way I found was to symlink the default folders to my VM partition
2015-11-08 20:21:39	theor	(even though that's quite ugly)
2015-11-08 20:21:57	muep	at least do not symlink it. libvirt allows you to specify extra locations without symlinking
2015-11-08 20:22:59	theor	the two symlinked folders are images and qemu, which stores the memory dump. i never saw an option to configure this last folder in virt-manager, hence the link

2015-11-08 20:23:42	muep	if you really end up having to use symlinks, symlink just this one directory

2015-11-08 21:55:18	muep	fedora mostly does not ship heavily modified kernels, so out-of-the-box ARM device support is limited to what mainline kernel.org kernels support

2015-11-08 22:32:33	astubbins	I don't think that will help. My biggest problem is that when a download times out, dnf deletes what has been downloaded so far and starts over.
2015-11-08 22:33:19	Khaytsus	dnf _used_ to do that..  maybe your dnf is old?
2015-11-08 22:33:31	Khaytsus	Pretty sure someone brought htis up about a week ago.. hmm
2015-11-08 22:33:48	astubbins	Khaytsus: This is a fresh install of Fedora 23.
2015-11-08 22:34:05	wadester	On a fresh F23 install, the "software" tool will not install anything -- I entered a bad password.  For some reason it would not prompt for a password again so was useless.  It seems to have timed out and is working now....  Note that dnf worked fine from the command line.....  Is this normal?
2015-11-08 22:34:05	astubbins	Though, I haven't updated it yet. Maybe I should see if updating dnf helps.
2015-11-08 22:34:09	Khaytsus	That's odd then, because it should keep the files around as of some time ago.
2015-11-08 22:34:38	Khaytsus	wadester: Once it "timed out" it worked?
2015-11-08 22:35:34	wadester	it kept giving an error.  I gave up and went to the command line (my normal mode), and after about 20 min tried the GUI again and it worked
2015-11-08 22:36:03	wadester	I was installing simple scan, audacity, simple things like that.

2015-11-08 22:36:45	nirik	yeah, the current behavior of dnf is to keep things until a transaction finishes successfully...
2015-11-08 22:36:54	bodhi_zazen	astubbins, see man dnf.conf
2015-11-08 22:37:16	astubbins	bodhi_zazen: I don't see any obvious options in there.
2015-11-08 22:37:47	bodhi_zazen	keepcache
2015-11-08 22:37:58	nirik	but you shouldn't need to set it...
2015-11-08 22:38:45	bodhi_zazen	shouldnt. but might check
2015-11-08 22:38:55	Khaytsus	Nope, I think default is to keep them until completed or cleaned
2015-11-08 22:39:03	Khaytsus	ALthough the manpage for keepcache is quite confusing ;)
2015-11-08 22:39:22	nirik	it seems fine here...
2015-11-08 22:39:32	astubbins	bodhi_zazen: Does that apply to partially downloaded packages though? And if so, can they be fully downloaded then?
2015-11-08 22:39:37	nirik	"Keep  downloaded  packages in the cache. If set to False and packages have not been
2015-11-08 22:39:37	nirik	              installed they will still persist until next successful transaction. The default is

2015-11-08 22:39:47	astubbins	Anyways, the man page says the default is false.
2015-11-08 22:40:23	nirik	astubbins: 'rpm -q dnf' ?
2015-11-08 22:40:34	Khaytsus	Seems like keepcache=true would keep the cache ;)  I dunno, wording just seems very odd.
2015-11-08 22:40:58	nirik	keepcache=true keeps it forever or until you 'dnf clean' it.
2015-11-08 22:40:58	astubbins	nirik: dnf-1.1.3-1.fc23.noarch
2015-11-08 22:41:08	lsr	wadester: I also have trouble with the gui installer that comes up but I haven't investigated it and I've heard of others with similar issues.
2015-11-08 22:41:23	nirik	keepcache=false (default) keeps it only until the transaction works.

2015-11-09 02:32:37	tamarin	Or is that a red herring?  radeon is the OSS xorg driver and "rides on top" of amdgpu for supported cards, but I thought other distros had you enable an amdgpu driver for xorg.

If i run `docker search centos` from gnome-terminal in a VNC session, it gives an error asking whether the docker daemon is running (fpaste.org/290373/ - it is running).  If i run the same command without VNC, or from a remote session, it works just fine.   Any ideas?

2015-11-14 10:42:16	jrobeson	it sure wouldn't
2015-11-14 10:42:26	jlim	he role back his involvement with the kernel and currently works for a private company
2015-11-14 10:42:53	--	frafra_ is now known as frafra
2015-11-14 10:43:21	shanemikel	jlim: linus did not 'land' a job.. he created one for himself.. he never would be what he is today on the quality of his references, or his personality, if not for the quality [greatly do to organic interest at the time in]/of his project
2015-11-14 10:43:47	jrobeson	jlim, that's not what this says
2015-11-14 10:43:48	jrobeson	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds#Later_years
2015-11-14 10:43:55	jrobeson	"Currently, the Linux Foundation sponsors Torvalds so he can work full-time on improving Linux"
2015-11-14 10:43:56	jlim	i send a link to the article for you
2015-11-14 10:44:05	shanemikel	linus is the worst example of what I'm looking for
2015-11-14 10:44:08	jrobeson	somebody needs to update the wikipedia then..
2015-11-14 10:44:16	bosim	But it is fine, I believe we all have a lot of respect for Linus, his "Scandinavian" honesty is definitely valuable for the Linux project, but some people have problems with his lack of politeness including the recent news on people leaving the kernel based on their expierences with Linus.
2015-11-14 10:44:23	jrobeson	lol quality shanemikel :)
2015-11-14 10:44:47	jrobeson	at the time it wasn't popular because quality.. it was popular due to a conflation of licensing factors, and being able to run on the GNU OS
2015-11-14 10:45:21	jrobeson	it was not considered quality .. even by linus himself
2015-11-14 10:45:44	shanemikel	right.. quality of his project (the qualities that separated it from the industry)
2015-11-14 10:46:08	shanemikel	and the community interest in that project at that time
2015-11-14 10:46:46	shanemikel	not necessarily code quality exclusively
2015-11-14 10:46:52	jrobeson	why is my bluetooth device not showing up :(
2015-11-14 10:46:53	bosim	Well if Linus didn't do it at that time, somebody else would have done it. Not sure it would have been that successful but still there was a need of a free operating system.
2015-11-14 10:47:38	jrobeson	yep
2015-11-14 10:49:02	shanemikel	using linus as an example, though, doesn't help me very much.. you might as well be my dad; everytime I talk about comp-sci, he tells me about gates and jobs
2015-11-14 10:49:34	shanemikel	so thanks.. for being the dad I don't need
2015-11-14 10:50:29	jrobeson	linus only came up because bosim misunderstood what i was saying about references
2015-11-14 10:51:22	shanemikel	jrobeson: sure, I was mainly talking to him.. I'm confident you understand what I'm asking about by now

2015-11-14 11:32:26	shanemikel	linuxuz3r: either way.. if you read that doc bit about module signing, and you come back here with some specific steps you've taken, and the problems you've encountered, I'm sure you'll find some more help
2015-11-14 11:32:33	linuxuz3r	i dont mind free but i really really like vmware
2015-11-14 11:33:56	shanemikel	okay, again.. why do you need secure boot vm?, and if so, spend the energy and try to sign your own modules.. it's in the docs afaict
2015-11-14 11:34:20	linuxuz3r	my vm uses regular bios
2015-11-14 11:34:23	linuxuz3r	legacy bios
2015-11-14 11:34:38	shanemikel	then why are you asking about signing modules?
2015-11-14 11:34:47	linuxuz3r	i get an error where i try to sign my own modules
2015-11-14 11:35:08	shanemikel	why are you trying to sign them if you don't need to
2015-11-14 11:35:41	linuxuz3r	i want to know if tainted modules performs the same compared to signed modules
2015-11-14 11:36:23	muep	signing is not expected to affect performance
2015-11-14 11:36:27	shanemikel	it is irrelevant if you're not using secure boot (either it won't load, or it will)
2015-11-14 11:36:39	linuxuz3r	oh ok
2015-11-14 11:36:56	muep	my impression is that even without secure boot, you could boot a kernel that will only load signed modules
2015-11-14 11:37:11	linuxuz3r	i guess the drivers for opengl 3.3 for vmware isnt stable
2015-11-14 11:37:34	linuxuz3r	now i dont know if i should get a refund for vmware
2015-11-14 11:37:42	linuxuz3r	thats the main reason why i bought it

2015-11-14 11:40:10	pdobrogost	Hi! I started to receive hundreds of emails from buildsys@fedoraproject.org about broken dependencies in various python-* packages. How can I unsubsribe from these?
2015-11-14 11:42:42	shanemikel	linuxuz3r: whether or not vmware is the right soft (or fedora is the right soft), is up to you to decide.. it's easier to give advice if you present specific goals and means... muep sorry, I don't mean to sound patronizing.. I literally have no idea, the most experience I have compiling kernel mods is with virtualbox guest additions and dkms/akmod

2015-11-14 14:59:04	@Khaytsus	I remember when I was studying for my CCNA I had to run some windows-only router emulator/simulator..  ran it in vmware on my p2 400mhz laptop with 768m of ram.
2015-11-14 14:59:58	jakethepython	this is a i5 Proc with 8 or 16 gb ram
2015-11-14 15:00:34	@Khaytsus	Oh, it'll run a vm really nice then

2015-11-14 15:01:26	@Khaytsus	libvirt is easy to use too..  Only caveat is if where /var is located doesn't have a lot of free space, just make sure when you're setting up the VM you allocate the disk space yourself.  Not a big deal, just takes a minute to figure out the process.
2015-11-14 15:01:41	jakethepython	ok
2015-11-14 15:01:48	@Khaytsus	Otherwise, it'll put your vm's disk in /var and even though it is a sparse image it'll take 2-3g
2015-11-14 15:01:49	cerriex	Sorry linuxmodder, What do you mean "on the live" when the lockups happen?

I want some (predefined, not randomly) clients to get IP/gateway/DNS/etc directly from ISP and others from my DHCP-server. Distinction might be done using MAC or some other property of the client (for example DHCP client identifier; but MAC is preferred). dnsmasq can both relay and serve dhcp but if you define both for the same interf
2015-11-17 21:37:32	Domine	Separate dhcp-fwd or dhcp-relay cannot use the same interface for relaying which is already used for dhcp-server.
2015-11-17 21:38:44	Domine	Is there a better way than defining a macvlan on dhcp-server interface, bind dhcp-relay to it, and ban some MACs for dhcp-server?

2015-11-17 21:57:08	Domine	b0bbi10, the first thing I'd try is just disabling internet for the installation, that way you will install kernel which is on livecd, not an updated one (I think there should be an option in the installer itself not to update, but I don't remember where it is)

2015-11-18 20:04:37	nico_	Hi, I am not able to start the tftp server in my computer even although I think I have correctly configured it
2015-11-18 20:04:48	nico_	do you have any ideas on what to try? I have run out of ideas
2015-11-18 20:05:00	billings	its a systemd socket, iirc
2015-11-18 20:06:27	TimeTravelDuck	Hello everybody. I have installed a new Graphic card (nVidia GTX 950) which replaces an old ATI Radeon 5770. Problem: now cinnamon (is a fedora 23 cinnamon spin) start in software mode even if the Nouveau drivers are installed and radeon drivers are uninstalled and the old card is on my desk. I have regenerated initramfs but nothing happened. What am I missing?

2015-11-18 20:07:07	TimeTravelDuck	nico_ , what is saying systemctl about tftp server?
2015-11-18 20:07:27	billings	I believe all you need to do is run 'systemctl enable tftp.socket'
2015-11-18 20:07:52	nico_	I am running centos :(
2015-11-18 20:08:02	billings	well, you could ask in #centos then
2015-11-18 20:08:13	billings	its the same if you're running centos7
2015-11-18 20:08:55	nico_	I am in centos 6.5 and I couldn't fix it in #centos.. I thought I could try here.
2015-11-18 20:09:10	Kellin	you don't need to run that, install tftp-server package and then enable it in /etc/xinetd.d/tftp
2015-11-18 20:09:22	Kellin	xinetd will kick off the tftp server on demand if you hit the port from outside
2015-11-18 20:09:37	billings	nico_: I'll answer you in #centos then
2015-11-18 20:09:51	Kellin	nico_: billings ^^

2015-11-18 21:08:31	ignacio_	i'm trying to install Fedora, but I get a error after partitioning the disk
2015-11-18 21:08:54	Southern_Gentlem	ignacio_,  how are you partitioning the disk
2015-11-18 21:08:57	ignacio_	It's on Spanish, but kinda "Error checking disk config"or something like that
2015-11-18 21:09:08	ignacio_	one sec
2015-11-18 21:09:20	Southern_Gentlem	you are partitioning in the installer?
2015-11-18 21:09:49	ignacio_	Southern_Gentlem: http://pasteboard.co/2eGvZqNf.png
2015-11-18 21:09:50	ignacio_	yes
2015-11-18 21:09:57	ignacio_	The ntfs partition is windows and I don't want to touch it
2015-11-18 21:10:07	Southern_Gentlem	yes i agree with that

2015-11-18 21:10:27	Southern_Gentlem	did you shrink the windows partition in windows and leave blank space on the drive
2015-11-18 21:10:37	ignacio_	no
2015-11-18 21:10:42	Southern_Gentlem	do that
2015-11-18 21:10:43	ignacio_	I mean, i had ubuntu before
2015-11-18 21:10:52	ignacio_	and removed the partition with gparted few minutes ago
2015-11-18 21:10:55	ignacio_	before the instalattion
2015-11-18 21:11:02	Kellin	so looking at that, I don't see a /boot partition defined
2015-11-18 21:11:19	ignacio_	The automatic partitioning is not working

2015-11-18 21:12:03	Southern_Gentlem	ignacio_, go into windows make sure there are no partitions left but your windows partitions
2015-11-18 21:12:12	ignacio_	The error is kinda: "sad puede no tener espacio suficiente para que grub2 incruste el archivo core.img al utilizar el sistema de archivos ext4 en el dispositivo partition"
2015-11-18 21:12:38	ignacio_	Southern_Gentlem: I'm sure of that
2015-11-18 21:12:41	Southern_Gentlem	then rerun the installer and manually setup your pratitions so youer windows ones dont gert blown away

2015-11-18 21:13:59	Southern_Gentlem	i told you how to fix the issue if you dont want to then fine
2015-11-18 21:14:00	ignacio_	I'm NOT playing with gparted..
2015-11-18 21:14:19	ignacio_	I've installed Fedora before, this is not my first time. My first time with the error
2015-11-18 21:14:44	Southern_Gentlem	then why are you even playing in gpartd then
2015-11-18 21:15:06	Southern_Gentlem	make sure windows sees the same as you want in gpartd
2015-11-18 21:15:07	ignacio_	Because i removed the ubuntu installation
2015-11-18 21:16:13	Kellin	ignacio_: so set / on sda2 to 20.43 GB and manually add a 500 MiB /boot partition in the custom partition screen in the installer and see if that gets you past the issue
2015-11-18 21:16:42	Southern_Gentlem	and if you had not played in gpartd the you could of easily told the fedora installer to nuke your ubuntu and preserve the windows

2015-11-18 21:17:58	Kellin	ignacio_: okay, so boot it off the installer, at the kernel line - add 'sshd'
2015-11-18 21:18:17	Kellin	you can ssh in with root@ the ip on the screen and grab the logs from /tmp
2015-11-18 21:18:25	Kellin	should be some clues in there

2015-11-19 00:08:15	Grinnz_	"installed" might not mean what you think it means
2015-11-19 00:08:29	Grinnz_	it could be the case that you dont actually have any groups marked as installed

2015-11-19 00:12:22	Grinnz_	well it's wrong then, i guess
2015-11-19 00:12:27	Pursuit	anyway, back to the original problem: I need a way to determine if a group is installed
2015-11-19 00:12:54	Pursuit	and "group info" doesn't have the info I need, and there's no way (that I can find) to make "group list" return only installed groups
2015-11-19 00:14:44	Grinnz_	yeah i dont see a way either
2015-11-19 00:15:08	Pursuit	figured out a backwards way: "yum group list <group name> | grep Installed"

2015-11-19 21:16:01	Adam2	muep: cuz i dont know
2015-11-19 21:16:25	Adam2	for example debian and debian based distros need sudo to do that
2015-11-19 21:17:01	muep	IIRC debian lets a normal local user run systemctl reboot
2015-11-19 21:17:46	muep	also IIRC debian for years has reacted to ctrl+alt+del from a normal local user by rebooting
2015-11-19 21:17:47	Adam2	without password?
2015-11-19 21:17:50	muep	yes
2015-11-19 21:18:14	Adam2	then why ubuntu and opensuse need sudo?
2015-11-19 21:18:27	Grinnz_	sudo is needed because you can ssh in
2015-11-19 21:18:35	Grinnz_	and also to modify root files
2015-11-19 21:18:38	Grinnz_	etc
2015-11-19 21:18:49	muep	IIRC ubuntu also allows local normal user to reboot without password
2015-11-19 21:18:55	Grinnz_	it's usually assumed a local user can just pull the plug if they really want to, so theres no point in restricting the shutdown functions
2015-11-19 21:19:16	muep	just the reboot binary has traditionally been one that is not able to request the reboot without root privileges

2015-11-19 21:20:03	ifreq	i assume it atleast should
2015-11-19 21:20:10	muep	why?
2015-11-19 21:20:24	muep	a server normally does not have normal users using it locally
2015-11-19 21:20:37	ifreq	ah true
2015-11-19 21:20:38	muep	and usually the local user tends to have access to the power switch

2015-11-20 23:17:28	mmaruseacph2	I have a huge problem when installing Fedora 23 workstation: the installer stops at "Creating users" step
2015-11-20 23:17:33	mmaruseacph2	it's been there for 30 minutes already
2015-11-20 23:17:58	mmaruseacph2	I'm installing it over a Fedora 20, keeping /home from that installation and overriding anything else
2015-11-20 23:18:08	mmaruseacph2	do you have any hints on how should I proceed?
2015-11-20 23:18:10	mmaruseacph2	thanks

2015-11-21 00:25:34	WHATTHEHELL	This old thinkpad has a goofy system architecture. On a normal PC if I press the "volume up" button on the keyboard, the system receives a keyboard event and turns the sound up through the driver...
2015-11-21 00:26:22	WHATTHEHELL	These old thinkpads however do it all in hardware. Pressing vol up causes an auxiliary processor to process the event and increase the gain on the onboard audio amplifiers, and store the change on a bit of static ram accessible on the system bus.

2015-11-21 23:01:08	bitlord	vbgunz_, also next time, you can man 8 dracut  and see TROUBLESHOOTING there is a  /run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt   if something fails and you get into the shell, also you can enable debugging  (I probably little late for this, it can take less time to diagnose it)
2015-11-21 23:01:57	linuxmodder	hence why I use nearly  all debugging bits as a default in grub
2015-11-21 23:02:25	vbgunz_	bitlord: thank you very much, I'm gonna reboot to test this out. if I fixed it, it went from hours at 100% broke to minutes 100% fixed. I hope

2015-11-21 23:07:12	vbgunz_	man, I spent a whole lot of my night and half my day on this and I took it back to completely broken and fixed it again in minutes
2015-11-21 23:07:37	vbgunz_	it looks like "dracut -k all -f" is what was destroying me. it would just completely render my boot useless

2015-11-21 23:10:55	vbgunz_	here's what's happening in case you're curious. I have a 2TB external drive. It mirrors my local internal drive and I keep it in sync using rsync -avPHAX ... anyhow, the external doesn't support efi so, only the following 2 lines fix that up. grub2-install --recheck /dev/sde --target=i386-pc AND dracut -f && grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg ... that was it :D
2015-11-21 23:11:26	vbgunz_	also, I did change up /etc/default/grub a bit and also modified /etc/crypttab a bit
2015-11-21 23:12:33	bitlord	I don't see -k all as valid in documentation, and you probably wanted to use -kver instead with specific kernel version
2015-11-21 23:13:16	bitlord	every time something breaks and you fix it, you learn something, next time these things will be easier for you to diagnose and fix ;-)
2015-11-21 23:14:21	vbgunz_	earlier in here, someone said I had to dracut -k all -f and several people agreed I needed to do it. it was sound and looked familiar and I just went with it NOT realizing that's what was breaking everything

I can't remember what my lspci output looked like, but I can share with you all of the commands that I went through to set it up (i just happen to have saved all of my logs)

After that I run HP-Device Manager from launcher and after that started to install plug-ins, but it doesn`t want to be installed. Plug-in installer is frozen every time. The most likely I did any mistake, who`s got the similar issue, help me, please. And also I tried to install hplip

2015-11-25 20:55:08	southwest	after compressing went from 348MB  to 235MB for my home folder
2015-11-25 20:55:12	fenrus02	i'd also suggest you backup your system config files and other important data (dbms, etc..)

2015-11-28 21:26:11	sdgathman	swex_: that is a *means*.  You're goal is probably to have access to the "server" while it is in the field, and have it transmit the data it gathers.

2015-11-29 00:00:24	Mac101	seems odd that they dont hold on a fedora release until rpm fusion is ready, i think if i understand they are seperate entities, but both parties could be saved headaches from users surely?

2015-11-29 00:04:14	Khaytsus	What's the problem anyway?  rpmfusion is fine in 23 isn't it?
2015-11-29 00:05:10	Mac101	hmm nope well i mean someone early told me it wasnt ready
2015-11-29 00:05:24	Mac101	i was trying to get mpv or vlc working with hardware accel
2015-11-29 00:05:38	Mac101	mpv wasnt in rpmf23
2015-11-29 00:05:54	Mac101	and cant get vlc working
2015-11-29 00:06:15	Khaytsus	Odd.  mpv is in 22, although I still use mplayer for some reason..  but I'm not watching anything big
2015-11-29 00:06:39	Mac101	i told everyone is moving to mpv cause its got active dev
2015-11-29 00:07:13	Khaytsus	I hadn't even heard of it until last week
2015-11-29 00:07:26	Mac101	when i did get it working it does seem to work fine apart from an ffmpeg warning which is assume is due to f23 ffmpeg
2015-11-29 00:07:37	Mac101	im told*
2015-11-29 00:08:29	Mac101	about the waiting for third party thing, dont all distro release need to waiting for third parties like gnome to be ready anyway?
2015-11-29 00:08:45	Mac101	isnt the whole os a composition of third party software
2015-11-29 00:09:10	Khaytsus	Very different.
2015-11-29 00:09:18	Mac101	man my typing is horrid today (apologies)
2015-11-29 00:09:19	Khaytsus	rpmfusion is a repo that Fedora does not need at all.
2015-11-29 00:10:00	Khaytsus	And as for something like Gnome..  Nope..  They make a decision, is it going to be ready for release or is the old version shipped, with a possible update.  It all depends.
2015-11-29 00:10:19	Khaytsus	But that said, Fedora would not stop ship for a Gnome release, unless it was something super important I guess.
2015-11-29 00:10:28	Mac101	are you a dev?
2015-11-29 00:10:31	Khaytsus	Because if you want for everyone, you'll never release.

2015-11-29 12:28:54	macieks	I'm using F23 x86_64 and wanted to install skype... I found that there's lpf-skype package and tried that but it failes on the installation process

2015-11-29 19:04:21	otila	Mac101: you can use iptables to block outgoing packets
2015-11-29 19:04:38	fenrus02	otila, he specifically requested a proxy :/
2015-11-29 19:04:44	kk4ewt	otila, not from the application layer
2015-11-29 19:04:45	fenrus02	otila, the problem there is that he has no actual goal

2015-11-29 19:05:13	Mac101	oh erm i am using iptables to drop everything except stuff that goes through the proxy
2015-11-29 19:05:17	smaug____	Any idea why Fedora updates have started to fail? I get error "failed to lookup digest in keyring"
2015-11-29 19:05:35	fenrus02	smaug, use the cli tool instead.  it'll work.
2015-11-29 19:05:39	otila	kk4ewt: yeah but if having one uid for one app usage.. then -m owner --uid-owner luser
2015-11-29 19:05:43	Mac101	my goal is to create the same sort of outgoing control i had on windows with a 3rd party firewall
2015-11-29 19:05:52	fenrus02	otila, wont work
2015-11-29 19:06:24	otila	fenrus02: why not?
2015-11-29 19:06:41	fenrus02	otila, ipt is not app-aware across systems.  he's looking or a proxy solution.
2015-11-29 19:06:41	otila	fenrus02: I know it's not really "app level fw"
2015-11-29 19:07:11	otila	but there is no proxy for every app
2015-11-29 19:07:13	fenrus02	s/ or/ for/
2015-11-29 19:07:20	fenrus02	otila, you sure about that?
2015-11-29 19:07:37	fenrus02	otila, i use a great many proxies for everything, from web traffic to irc ..
2015-11-29 19:07:47	oceanpollen	otila, unrelated to whatever this question actually is, that uid filtering only works for output.  any UID process can still listen on the port.
2015-11-29 19:08:21	Mac101	fenrus02 do you use squid then?
2015-11-29 19:08:29	otila	oceanpollen: but not establish new connections if iptables blocks it
2015-11-29 19:08:31	oceanpollen	well I would assume that not being to output processes would break things before a connection could be established...
2015-11-29 19:08:40	oceanpollen	*packets
2015-11-29 19:08:43	fenrus02	Mac101, sure. it works.
2015-11-29 19:09:08	oceanpollen	better test it.  I was worried about servers getting information from requests even if they couldn't reply.
2015-11-29 19:09:56	otila	tested already > 10 years ago
2015-11-29 19:10:09	Mac101	otila with your method how do you run gui apps as different uids?
2015-11-29 19:10:23	Mac101	gksu?
2015-11-29 19:10:56	oceanpollen	mac, xauth
2015-11-29 19:11:15	Mac101	otila also how did you get round dnf updating as that requires opening lots of stuff in iptables?
2015-11-29 19:11:19	otila	Mac101: xauth forwarding unfortunately, waiting till wayland gets something like that working
2015-11-29 19:12:04	otila	Mac101: squid

2015-11-29 20:36:15	Mac101	ladies but not for specific applications, without an elaborate solution involving passing apps through a proxy
2015-11-29 20:37:06	Mac101	or creating another user and xforwarding

2015-11-29 20:39:12	ladies	Mac101: So your application needs port 3428 open. It finds out that port is not open (a little bit sensitive but lets pretend it knows). So now there should be an API for the app to query the os and ask for permission to open the port.

2015-11-29 20:40:35	Mac101	nope if user enables outgoing control, they are taking responsibility for opening the right ports, for apps
2015-11-29 20:40:38	Mac101	as on windows

2015-11-29 20:42:10	ladies	even then I didn't 'use' it.
2015-11-29 20:42:32	oceanpollen	more like 'like with Android', which is able to do this with iptables because apps actually all are run under different UIDs

2015-11-29 21:44:38	otila	did you configure apache to listen on correct IPs?
2015-11-29 21:44:52	GillesM	no
2015-11-29 21:44:57	otila	:)
2015-11-29 21:45:04	GillesM	It is my first time on fedora
2015-11-29 21:45:04	GillesM	I use Debian or ubuntu ...
2015-11-29 21:45:11	muep	afaik httpd in fedora defaults to listening to all ip addresses
2015-11-29 21:45:44	GillesM	I installed fedora to learn SELinux
2015-11-29 21:45:57	oceanpollen	lsof -i -nnP |grep :80  #  will show you what apache's listening on
2015-11-29 21:46:04	muep	I pretty much never need to configure specific ip addresses to httpd. but you need to open http port in firewall if you want other hosts to reach your httpd in port 80
2015-11-29 21:46:54	GillesM	whttpd    1661   root    4u  IPv6  25036      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)

2015-11-29 21:47:07	GillesM	is it usgin iptable ?
2015-11-29 21:48:07	kk4ewt	GillesM,  it uses firewalld to talk to iptables
2015-11-29 21:48:25	GillesM	how do I kill Firewalld
2015-11-29 21:48:35	kk4ewt	why not learn it
2015-11-29 21:49:31	GillesM	where do I stop a daemon ?
2015-11-29 21:49:40	muep	systemctl stop firewalld would stop it
2015-11-29 21:50:07	muep	but if you need to know selinux, you should likely also know how to manage a firewall tool
2015-11-29 21:50:32	muep	the command I gave should open the http port for you

2015-11-30 11:59:15	anoopcs	ePirat, I think its grub2-update or update-grub2. Let me check.
2015-11-30 11:59:47	ePirat	there is no such tool for me
2015-11-30 12:02:17	anoopcs	ePirat, Ooops. Apparently, grub2-mkconfig is enough for grub2.
2015-11-30 12:02:27	ePirat	additionally wiki always says /boot/grub2/grub.cfg but shouldn't it be /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg for EFI?
2015-11-30 12:03:51	anoopcs	ePirat, Are you sure that you replaced the original value in /etc/default/grub?
2015-11-30 12:04:33	ePirat	you mean for GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX?
2015-11-30 12:04:46	anoopcs	ePirat, Yes.
2015-11-30 12:04:52	ePirat	yes, and it did work fine
2015-11-30 12:05:05	ePirat	splash screen had correct resolution after that
2015-11-30 12:05:16	ePirat	although fedora would hang at the splash screen now
2015-11-30 12:05:38	ePirat	even setting it back to text did not fix it
2015-11-30 12:06:00	ePirat	so I assume somehow grub2-mkconfig broke something

2015-11-30 13:41:24	howi	ok
2015-11-30 13:41:42	davbreen	the issue is that running `ip route add ..` on the other computers shouldn't be necessary after configuring a static route on the asus router... or at least that's how I understand it

SSH can open a connection but then hangs. tshark sees a SYN and then SYN ACK, but the ACK from the computer never makes it to the VM (and I get spurious retransmissions of the SYN ACK)
2015-11-30 13:44:43	davbreen	howi: I'm not sure to be honest. I was hoping it wasn't the asus, because that seems harder to fix than a PEBKAC.

2015-11-30 17:52:49	davbreen	Hi! I've got a really strange problem. I've configured a static route on my asus router: 192.168.200.0/24 (VMs) via 192.168.1.200 (libvirt host). Basically, TCP seems to only half work. I can ping a VM from my laptop, and can initiate an SSH connection but it never completes (SYN sent, SYN ACK received, ACK never makes it to the VM).
