2015-11-08 14:35:50	FernandoBasso	So, for both class variable and class instance variable, I use self.prop to create the getter?
2015-11-08 14:36:20	Mon_Ouie	'def self.foo' defines a method on self's singleton class. After that, you can do self.foo to call it. Inside a class body, self happens to be the class you're defining.
2015-11-08 14:36:49	Mon_Ouie	If you want to access them with ClassName.variable_name, yes
2015-11-08 14:37:01	FernandoBasso	Okay. Thanks.

2015-11-08 21:14:04	take-	well if you already have the code, technically it can't be TDD retroactively, since 'test driven' requires you to write tests first
2015-11-08 21:14:20	take-	so proper TDD would mean developing further code by writing tests first, then making them pass with code

2016-01-10 21:20:45	shevy	a simple batch install for the .gem files there would be  "gem install --ignore-dependencies -no-ri -no-rdoc ./*.gem" but if you really have more than one ruby versions, perhaps you may also have more than one gem versions. do you arch people not have a wiki that recommends how you properly upgrade by the way?
2016-01-10 21:21:25	shevy	because there is no normal way that the C API version changes unless you change the ruby version itself, and you said you no longer use 2.2.0 you use 2.3.0 suddenly
2016-01-10 21:21:26	havenwood	sjums: Gem binaries are installed with hardcoded paths to Ruby by default. There's an --env-shebang option and a proposal to enable it by default in RubyGems has been accepted and is currently set to the RubyGems 2.6 milestone. The easiest way for now is to reinstall your gems on 2.3.0.
2016-01-10 21:21:34	choke	i have 3 versions of ruby myself lol
2016-01-10 21:21:46	sjums	there's a pretty good wiki for Arch, yes. Exactly if there's anything specific for ruby I don't know
2016-01-10 21:22:18	havenwood	sjums: I set --env-shebang in my ~/.gemrc which makes upgrading TINY versions easy. I still reinstall gems for MINOR version updates.
2016-01-10 21:22:22	sjums	I think I'll just roll with the reinstall your gems idea
2016-01-10 21:22:47	havenwood	sjums: Just an aside, but chruby works well with Arch Rubies: https://gist.github.com/jhass/8839655bb038e829fba1

2016-01-11 20:36:21	argentdrake	I'm having trouble with hashes, I've generated 1 mil random nums, and I want to put them into a hash using their random nums as keys, if the key already exists, I would like to increment the value at the key so that I may count how many times a number occured.

2016-01-13 21:28:30	tvsutton	I have a general Rake question: I'm working on a project with a very large Rakefile and it makes branching/merging problematic because many changes go into a single file. I was looking at splitting it up using simply the "rakelib/foo.rake" pattern. Does this method have any disadvantages for simply splitting up our tasks into files more logically?
