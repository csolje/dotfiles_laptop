2016-01-07 21:20:02	flappynerd	nsahoo, as I said, if you don't want to use surround, your other basic option is to search for something you find suitable by using the search page on http://www.vim.org/scripts

2016-01-07 21:21:26	flappynerd	nsahoo, you'll still need to, no matter what, 1) select the text you wish to italicize, 2) hit some key that invokes the markdown plugin and then 3) hit some key that chooses the "italicize" feature of your markdown plugin
2016-01-07 21:21:46	flappynerd	nsahoo, with surround.vim it's actually better because you still do the same 3 things, but it's universal to any language
2016-01-07 21:22:02	flappynerd	1) select your text, 2) hit S to invoke surround and 3) hit * because * is italic in markdown
2016-01-07 21:22:09	flappynerd	or is it _ lol I can never remember
2016-01-07 21:22:30	flappynerd	nsahoo, surround.vim also works with balanced pairs like () [] and {}
2016-01-07 21:22:46	flappynerd	and really almost any character at all, like ^ or +

2016-01-07 21:56:01	flappynerd	but if you really want, you can probably make a tags file and use that
2016-01-07 21:56:45	john_doe_jr	flappynerd: ok so CTRL-n brings up a lot of values
2016-01-07 21:56:51	Zeedox	IMO all the default completion options in vim are a bit confusing.
2016-01-07 21:57:00	Zeedox	Can be nice to have it wrapped up.
2016-01-07 21:57:04	flappynerd	john_doe_jr, yep, but you said you wanted to start with a prefix like function

2016-01-07 21:57:23	flappynerd	john_doe_jr, you can simply keep typing and filter the list slowly until you get a list that's reasonable to work with
2016-01-07 21:57:30	Zeedox	Although C-n and C-x C-n does 90% of what I want.

2016-01-07 21:59:38	flappynerd	Zeedox, many/most IDEs will bring up a completion list when you type . for example whether you want that list or not
2016-01-07 21:59:59	flappynerd	Zeedox, in vim, by default, you don't get a completion list unless you "ask" for it by explicitly typing something like CTRL-n
2016-01-07 22:00:17	Zeedox	I mean, in an object-oriented language, '.', '->' or whatever the syntax is IS an indicator that you'd want completion, I'd say.
2016-01-07 22:00:23	flappynerd	Zeedox, not at all

2016-01-07 22:01:50	Zeedox	Then again, I'd like completion just when writing prose at well. :)
2016-01-07 22:02:09	flappynerd	esp, given that even in the best case, language-parsing-auto-completion is wicked slow
2016-01-07 22:02:29	flappynerd	Zeedox, sure, and actually prose is another pretty code case for CTRL-n "on demand"

2016-01-07 22:07:48	flappynerd	john_doe_jr, Zeedox, I don't doubt that some people have and use "reasonably fast" auto completion, but I still maintain that if they took the time to just use the simple version of CTRL-n that they'd find that CTRL-n provides far more overall net benefit than what they're used to
2016-01-07 22:08:00	flappynerd	Zeedox, if you name and IDE, I've probably used it
2016-01-07 22:08:00	Zeedox	Loading up for example the Django project, which is decently sized, has never caused delay for me with that setup.

This will disable the latter half of the file. Retest to see if your problem persists. If so then the problem is inside the still active half. Otherwise the problem is in the disabled half.

2016-01-08 21:34:32	tailgate	goes back to normal mode. I use it to get out of long error messages.
2016-01-08 21:35:01	tailgate	also, you could just set g:ycm_confirm_extra_conf
2016-01-08 21:35:19	Alissa	You need to confirm it at least once
2016-01-08 21:35:28	Alissa	Unfortunately mine's not letting me confirm it at all.
2016-01-08 21:35:57	tailgate	and this only happened when it loaded that?
2016-01-08 21:36:38	Alissa	I open the file, start typing "#include <" (and I have tested this without AutoPairs) and it only prints out the dialog with no ability to interact with it
2016-01-08 21:36:57	Alissa	C-C didn't help
2016-01-08 21:37:03	tailgate	hmm. I don't think anyone here can resolve that
2016-01-08 21:37:12	tailgate	probobly because it's specific to that terminal
2016-01-08 21:38:08	Alissa	No, it's not.
2016-01-08 21:38:15	Alissa	xfce4-terminal at home has the same issue.
2016-01-08 21:38:31	Alissa	I'll go update ycm and see if that changes anything, although I doubt it will

2016-01-08 23:06:43	flappynerd	sjohnson, it's probably your config/plugins, not vim itself
2016-01-08 23:06:44	drleviathan	btw, what is your platform and hardware (yeah)
2016-01-08 23:06:51	flappynerd	vim is wicked fast for me, pretty much always has been
2016-01-08 23:07:06	flappynerd	I've had slowdowns once or twice, but it was always some plugin or config malfunction
2016-01-08 23:07:25	flappynerd	hell, vim is wicked fast even on a 386 with damnsmalllinux or similar
2016-01-08 23:08:02	drleviathan	I think I once saw slow vim on windows (cygwin) when I had a lot of plugins, or some problematic plugin.  Slow to open file.
2016-01-08 23:08:15	flappynerd	well, vim will be slow to open like a 5G file

2016-01-08 23:09:21	flappynerd	nshp, indeed, vim's regex is not massively performant
2016-01-08 23:09:36	flappynerd	but then again, performant engines like perl don't give you advanced zero-width assertions like vim does
2016-01-08 23:09:40	flappynerd	so, with power comes a price

2016-01-09 21:52:23	athan	Hello everyone, I'm on mac right now, and was wondering how I could map unicode characters to commands with `:noremap` and friends. The reason why I need to, is from the `Alt-{` character sequence. When I run `cat` with no arguments, and perform that sequence, I get `“`. Likewise, `‘` for `Alt-}`. How could I map this to a command?

2016-01-12 23:34:20	flappynerd	Nemno, I used to align periods and equals signs obsessively, however I've since come to realize that while it "looks nice" it actually can hinder readability in many cases, esp with equal signs if you get long identifiers, it makes it difficult sometimes to visually see which LHS and RHS correspond

2016-01-15 21:17:35	swimmer	I see ... I think I should explain a bit more in detail: sometimes I'm writing down ideas/lessons in text files and use markdown formatting for that. Applying a modeline 'ft={asciidoc|markdown|rst}' displays that formatting nicely. I'd like to use ':Voom <markdown>' for an outlined tree for some of those files.
2016-01-15 21:18:01	swimmer	Hence my question for a file specific solution and not a generic solution
2016-01-15 21:18:48	ginkoms	any idea what I should use for firefox to get vim like bindings?

2016-01-15 22:10:12	k4jcw	Hello. I open a file in vim, e.g. 'vim foo'. Then I'll do a :vs and :e xxx to edit two files side by side. But sometimes it starts diffing them. I thought I used to be able to say ':diffoff' in each window and it would disable them. But whatever I do, when I start editing these two files side by side, it switches to diff mode. Why?
2016-01-15 22:10:54	flappynerd	k4jcw: disable plugins and config, see if it still happens
2016-01-15 22:10:54	romainl	you can use :vs like :e

The vendor had bugs and claimed they had to upgrade to 3 to fix them (true or not, I don't know). But it made us have to upgrade also, and probably set us back 3 weeks or so, all told.

2016-01-16 01:04:51	SrPx	Yay. Managed to make it work. Had 2 issues:
2016-01-16 01:05:08	SrPx	1. ctags, as pre-installed on OSX, is broken and doesn't support -R (??)

2016-01-16 01:05:38	flappynerd	SrPx: well, it's just not "exuberant-ctags" is basically the problem
2016-01-16 01:06:02	SrPx	2. seems like gutentags didn't identify any project marker on my project and was trying to tag the whole system or something, so I ran a void "git init" just to make it clear.
2016-01-16 01:06:28	SrPx	oh okay, makes sense flappynerd
2016-01-16 01:06:56	flappynerd	SrPx: brew install ctags; should give you exuberant ctags (I think)
2016-01-16 01:06:59	flappynerd	I know it's in homebrew at least

2016-01-16 01:07:49	flappynerd	and vim plugins as well
2016-01-16 01:07:49	SrPx	hm... yet... seems like on my Python codebase "tag MyClass" goes to the import line, not to the class. Am I doing it wrong?

2016-01-16 01:08:52	flappynerd	I gave up using anything tag related a long time ago
