2016-01-05 23:29:06	GangstaCat	I'm trying to install a package I just compiled, following the wiki (xbps-src article) I'm stuck at this step:
2016-01-05 23:29:17	GangstaCat	Once the package-step ran through successfully, you can install your package:
2016-01-05 23:29:17	GangstaCat	 sudo xbps-install --repository=hostdir/binpkgs/my-cool-new-package-branch my-cool-new-package

2016-01-06 01:03:26	Hoerzoektvrouw	Is there any way within runit/1 to tell the system to skip 2 altogether and proceed straight to 3/

2016-01-06 01:03:40	duncaen	oO

2016-01-06 01:06:56	Hoerzoektvrouw	Ahh
2016-01-06 01:07:02	Hoerzoektvrouw	So is there a way?
2016-01-06 01:09:04	duncaen	dont really know atm reading the source, it doesnt listen for signals except in stage 2
2016-01-06 01:09:32	duncaen	not sure if it handles exit codes of stages and what happens
2016-01-06 01:10:04	duncaen	from man runit
2016-01-06 01:10:06	duncaen	"If /etc/runit/1 crashes, or exits 100, runit will skip stage 2 and enter stage 3. "
2016-01-06 01:11:09	duncaen	Hoerzoektvrouw: thats exactly what your looking for right?
2016-01-06 01:14:11	Hoerzoektvrouw	Ahh
2016-01-06 01:14:15	Hoerzoektvrouw	Yes, thatis exactly what I am looking for
2016-01-06 01:14:19	Hoerzoektvrouw	I couldn't find that
2016-01-06 01:17:49	duncaen	interesting if stage 2 crashes or exits with 111 it kills all childs and goes back one stage
2016-01-06 01:19:13	Vaelatern	duncaen: Do you know anything about ocaml?
2016-01-06 01:19:21	duncaen	no sorry

2016-01-06 01:19:54	duncaen	some
2016-01-06 01:20:49	duncaen	somewhere it calls /usr/bin/ld instead of ${XBPS_CROSS_BASE}/usr/bin/ld

2016-01-08 20:28:13	FlyingJester	There is a flash-pugin.
2016-01-08 20:28:24	FlyingJester	But I think you need to use xbps-src to install it.
2016-01-08 20:28:26	FlyingJester	At least I did.
2016-01-08 20:28:30	ke7ofi	What's it called? xbps-query didn't find it.
2016-01-08 20:28:31	ke7ofi	oh
2016-01-08 20:28:36	ke7ofi	Where can I find it?
2016-01-08 20:28:53	FlyingJester	I did it by cloning the void-packages archive, then using xbps-src.
2016-01-08 20:29:04	duncaen	git clone github.com/voidlinux/void-packages.git
2016-01-08 20:29:07	FlyingJester	And by archive I meant repo :X
2016-01-08 20:29:34	ke7ofi	So not everything in void-packages is in Void packages?
2016-01-08 20:29:44	FlyingJester	There was also a bug with accepting the license when I tried it, but I think that was promptly fixed when I pointed it out.
2016-01-08 20:29:58	ke7ofi	I thought that repo was the same as what I'd see running xbps-query.
2016-01-08 20:30:05	duncaen	ke7ofi: yes all packages are in void-packages
2016-01-08 20:30:25	FlyingJester	But there are some things in vid-packages not in repo.voidlinux.eu
2016-01-08 20:30:39	FlyingJester	Which is especially noticeable for alternative setups, like musl
2016-01-08 20:30:49	duncaen	yes but flash is "tagged" as restricted and won't be build by the buildserver and therefor doesn't show up in xbps-query
2016-01-08 20:31:00	ke7ofi	thanks, that explains it
2016-01-08 20:31:15	duncaen	https://wiki.voidlinux.eu/Flash
2016-01-08 20:31:26	ke7ofi	This is similar to the Ubuntu restricted package?
2016-01-08 20:31:37	ke7ofi	(or metapackage, it's been years)
2016-01-08 20:32:49	duncaen	don't know about ubuntus ones but its like there are build templates and you can easily build them but we wont build them on the buildserver because the license disallows redistribution

2016-01-08 20:37:49	Ypnose	just enough for my 20 thinkpads!
2016-01-08 20:38:17	FlyingJester	Is there a package for a program called `msgfmt`? xbps-query -o msgfmt didn't return anything.
2016-01-08 20:38:31	Ypnose	duncaen: On indiegogo page, I asked "Do you plan to provide and maintain patches in order to build Linux kernel, outside OpenWrt? Support longterm kernels like 4.1.x could be very VERY interesting…"

2016-01-08 20:38:47	ke7ofi	I could use a ThinkPad or 20.
2016-01-08 20:39:05	ke7ofi	I had an E535, but it physically broke, so I got a ProBook.
2016-01-08 20:39:11	ke7ofi	It's a bit heavy, though.

2016-01-08 20:40:17	Ypnose	upstream and 4.4 is fine to me
2016-01-08 20:40:28	Ypnose	and also ≠ OpenWrt
2016-01-08 20:42:00	Ypnose	ke7ofi: the best thinkpads are from the business market (X series)
2016-01-08 20:42:44	Ypnose	even recent HP ZBooks or EliteBooks are far less good

2016-01-09 21:28:09	Gottox	no
2016-01-09 21:28:18	Gottox	it's already there
2016-01-09 21:28:24	Gottox	xbps-query -o only works for installed packages.
2016-01-09 21:28:27	maldridge	xastir is already in repo?
2016-01-09 21:28:35	Gottox	ah, thought printproto
2016-01-09 21:28:39	Gottox	no :)

2016-01-09 21:29:15	maldridge	I'm working through packaging most of the AX.25 stack, and that would mean that it was all already here!
2016-01-09 21:29:27	Gottox	xbps-query -Ro works for all packages, but it's nearly unusable atm.
2016-01-09 21:29:43	maldridge	because of speed issues?
2016-01-09 21:29:56	maroni	Gottox: thanks for the quick answer, btw nice talk without kittens
2016-01-09 21:30:06	Gottox	hehe, thanks :)
2016-01-09 21:31:00	Gottox	maldridge: because it loads a shitload of data from remote.
2016-01-09 21:31:44	Gottox	there's a good wrapper in xtools for that, called xlocate.
2016-01-09 21:32:17	maldridge	ok, I figured it was something like that; though at the moment I think the slowdown is on the repo side, I'm pretty sure I'm maxing out that link
2016-01-09 21:33:29	maroni	maldridge: I'm not good at bash at the moment, I still have no github account, I have to read more manuals, before playing around with package building, sorry.

2016-01-10 19:22:11	dominikh	the only ridiculous memory consumer in zfs is the online dedup, which you are unlikely to use.

2016-01-12 22:19:15	duncaen	what?
2016-01-12 22:20:04	maldridge	setting the path shouldn't have any effect because the configure script is hard coded to look for i686-pc-cygwin-windres

2016-01-12 22:21:52	duncaen	i would still use the patch you have but change cross_compiling to yes there if CROSSCOMPPATH is set or something
2016-01-12 22:22:29	maldridge	yes, but the configure script doesn't look for any kind of path, it looks for the single executable I pasted above
2016-01-12 22:23:34	duncaen	$CROSSCOMPPATH is a path where it looks for libs for libs and headers
2016-01-12 22:23:44	duncaen	-I$CROSSCOMPPATH/gtk/include -I$CROSSCOMPPATH/gtk/include/glib -I$CROSSCOMPPATH/gtk/include/gdk
2016-01-12 22:23:53	duncaen	but the paths seems strange too
2016-01-12 22:24:48	maldridge	yes, if it was looking for the include headers I would agree that would be the fix.  However, it is looking for a single, hard-coded, executable for the cross compiler and failing to find it because for obvious reasons, I'm not using cygwin here
2016-01-12 22:32:46	maldridge	by setting cross_compiling=no and passing "--host" to configure, it gets farther, but then freaks out that it cna't run the C code it spits out
2016-01-12 22:34:01	chris2	xtraeme: i think using truncate is better still

2016-01-12 23:11:53	maldridge	yeah, I ran your patches locally; dunno why its using a wierd include dir

2016-01-13 21:43:08	dominikh	so… new security release for Go fixes a real but unlikely issue in TLS (more precisely its bignum code). do we rebuild all our Go programs, or chance it?
2016-01-13 21:43:28	chris2	the joy of static linking
2016-01-13 21:43:43	dominikh	chris2: yes, almost as bad as a soname bump :P
2016-01-13 21:43:48	chris2	;)
2016-01-13 21:44:06	chris2	can we verify which pkg use the code in question?
2016-01-13 21:44:30	dominikh	it'd take more human resources figuring that out than just rebuilding all the packages :>
2016-01-13 21:44:46	chris2	we have like 5 go packages no?
2016-01-13 21:44:56	dominikh	22 using the go build style
2016-01-13 21:45:02	chris2	ok
2016-01-13 21:45:12	chris2	bump them, who cares
2016-01-13 21:45:20	dominikh	it's the right thing to do I guess
2016-01-13 21:45:23	chris2	builds fast enough anyway
2016-01-13 21:45:30	chris2	xrevbump exists ;)
2016-01-13 21:45:33	dominikh	is there an xtool that revbumps a package?
2016-01-13 21:45:36	dominikh	whee
2016-01-13 21:45:41	duncaen	xD
2016-01-13 21:45:57	chris2	grep -l go */templates | xrevbump "go oops" -
2016-01-13 21:46:12	duncaen	that seems to much xd
2016-01-13 21:46:20	dominikh	I can figure out a better search pattern :P
2016-01-13 21:46:26	chris2	yeah
2016-01-13 21:47:13	dominikh	I don't like how some tools operate on package names and some on template files
2016-01-13 21:47:53	chris2	README tells :>
2016-01-13 21:49:07	chris2	xlint and xrevbump operate on files
2016-01-13 21:49:17	chris2	and xgensum
2016-01-13 21:49:24	chris2	because they change the files
2016-01-13 21:49:31	chris2	and xbump operates on the whole directory
2016-01-13 21:50:54	dominikh	then why isn't the xbump argument a directory ;)
2016-01-13 21:51:00	chris2	it is
2016-01-13 21:51:20	dominikh	relative to ., not to srcpkgs :P
2016-01-13 21:51:30	chris2	no
2016-01-13 21:51:39	chris2	ah
2016-01-13 21:51:42	dominikh	will xrevbump append the name of all packages to the commit msg?
2016-01-13 21:51:49	chris2	i use it from srcpkgs so completion works :D
2016-01-13 21:51:52	dominikh	:D
2016-01-13 21:51:53	chris2	dominikh: prepend, yes
2016-01-13 21:51:57	dominikh	prepend, sorry
2016-01-13 21:52:10	chris2	read the fine source ;)
2016-01-13 21:52:17	chris2	xrevbump also works on directories
2016-01-13 21:52:37	dominikh	heh
2016-01-13 21:52:42	chris2	but then that grep trick doesnt work ;)
2016-01-13 21:53:28	dominikh	also it really shouldn't require the "-" argument, it should just read from stdin if there's no 2nd arg :)
2016-01-13 21:53:43	chris2	no
2016-01-13 21:53:46	dominikh	why no
2016-01-13 21:53:54	chris2	then xargs breaks
2016-01-13 21:54:11	dominikh	fair enough
2016-01-13 21:54:21	dominikh	wait, how so?
2016-01-13 21:54:26	chris2	when you have no argumnts
2016-01-13 21:54:38	dominikh	then why would xargs run xrevbump?
2016-01-13 21:54:47	chris2	because you didnt use xargs -r ;)
2016-01-13 21:54:59	dominikh	use -r then :P
2016-01-13 21:55:07	chris2	we should just remove - and make people use xe ;)
2016-01-13 21:55:17	dominikh	heh
2016-01-13 21:55:24	dominikh	xe is still too pc for me
2016-01-13 21:55:35	chris2	i cant find the go diff
2016-01-13 21:55:39	chris2	pc?

2016-01-13 22:01:41	chris2	i think there is a language tree that mentions it

2016-01-13 22:03:19	dominikh	but it doesn't *depend* on PA
2016-01-13 22:03:26	dominikh	but if you want bluetooth audio you need PA

2016-01-13 23:11:30	dominikh	.. why does the readme even suggest that that's the normal way of doing it? most people will skip the first two commands (which don't bloody work anyway)
2016-01-13 23:11:39	dominikh	starting with the 3rd command now. *looks like* it's working
2016-01-13 23:12:22	duncaen	yea little bit redundant

2016-01-13 23:12:46	duncaen	and base-chroot-musl is already there thanks to the muslrepo right?
2016-01-13 23:12:50	dominikh	right.
2016-01-13 23:13:14	dominikh	the first two commands would make sense for a completely new architecture. if they worked.

2016-01-14 00:15:58	dominikh	also.. when we got rid of foo-git packages, did we agree to instead hiding them behind 0.0.<date> and pretending that's not the exact same thing?
2016-01-14 00:16:26	duncaen	software is crazy
2016-01-14 00:16:39	dominikh	so are our maintainers
2016-01-14 00:16:46	duncaen	is it pulling head/master?
2016-01-14 00:17:14	dominikh	no, a commit. but the last time they updated that was in july. and the only reason they pull a commit is because the last official release was over a year ago
2016-01-14 00:17:18	dominikh	why not ask for a release instead
2016-01-14 00:17:27	dominikh	instead of having more never-updated software in the repo
2016-01-14 00:18:58	duncaen	litcave stuff like fbpdf is packaged as 0.0.$DATE too but that guy makes no releases for all of his stuff like >=10 nice projects without any release

2016-01-14 22:02:50	dominikh	hrm. so, there's a programm called "glabels". its version is 3.2.1. its library files (public) are called libglabels-3.0.so.8 – wth do I name the package? "glabels" seems wrong because of the -3.0 in the .so – glabels3 seems okayish, but the .so is 3.0, not 3, so what if there's a 3.1? glabels3.1 isn't possible, and glabels31 is awful (I know we have lua52, but glabels is an actual end-user program) – or
2016-01-14 22:02:52	dominikh	do I make it glabels and libglabels30?

2016-01-14 23:11:49	edr	xargs and find are missing, so the glibc config fails
2016-01-14 23:12:09	duncaen	hm did you run it with a different XBPS_TARGET_ARCH or did you use a very old image?
2016-01-14 23:12:26	⚡	maldridge bets the installer image was old
2016-01-14 23:12:30	edr	no, a pretty up to date iso I would say. All of this 64 bit
2016-01-14 23:12:43	edr	let me check the installer image
2016-01-14 23:12:44	uriah	edr: what's the iso's date?
2016-01-14 23:13:23	duncaen	sounds like missing xbps-alternatives
2016-01-14 23:13:31	uriah	yeah...
2016-01-14 23:13:38	edr	hmm well ok july 15
2016-01-14 23:13:45	uriah	yeah update
2016-01-14 23:13:51	edr	but in fact why does it matter while bootstrapping?
2016-01-14 23:14:01	uriah	not sure xbps-alternatives even existed back then... right?
2016-01-14 23:14:08	uriah	and that's what sets up the symlinks now
2016-01-14 23:14:22	duncaen	the image is from a time where xbps-alternatives wasn't there, new packages now use xbps-alternatives features
2016-01-14 23:14:30	edr	well I did the chroot install procedure with that image and it worked ok
2016-01-14 23:14:42	edr	back in september
2016-01-14 23:14:56	uriah	yeah xbps-alternatives is new since like november
2016-01-14 23:14:59	uriah	or october
2016-01-14 23:15:26	edr	Is that why you don't have to download and unpack a tarball upon install anymore?
2016-01-14 23:16:26	duncaen	http://www.voidlinux.eu/news/2015/11/xbps-0.50.html
2016-01-14 23:16:33	duncaen	10.11
2016-01-14 23:16:56	duncaen	edr: dont know what tarball you mean
2016-01-14 23:17:45	duncaen	did you already try xbps-install -Su
2016-01-14 23:17:46	edr	So when I did my install on this computer one step in the installation instructions was to download a tarball and unpack it to the target directory
2016-01-14 23:18:10	duncaen	hm never heard about it
2016-01-14 23:18:35	duncaen	only to install from a different distribution you can download the static xbps builds and use them from debian or arch as example
2016-01-14 23:19:19	edr	it contained files from /usr/bin and /usr/share I believe and yes, it had files like xbps-install.static and all that in it. Still have these files on my system
2016-01-14 23:19:43	edr	So I was suprised this step was removed from the instructins
2016-01-14 23:20:27	duncaen	hm maybe that was to avoid these xbps-alternatives things on old images, but never noticed it in the instructions
2016-01-14 23:21:03	edr	Ok. Nevermind. Just wanted to make sure this did not get lost unintentially in the transition to the new wiki or anything like that
2016-01-14 23:21:17	edr	I'll go ahead and grab a new iso.
2016-01-14 23:21:38	edr	And hey, thanks to you all for making void happen. This is really a great piece of work!
2016-01-14 23:22:15	duncaen	i think your setup is fixable if you just chroot into your installation and update xbps and run xbps-pkgdb -a
2016-01-14 23:23:25	edr	Oh no worries. I was just playing around with the installation procedure in a vm. My normal machine runs fine
2016-01-14 23:24:18	edr	I am trying to put together a bootstrap script which reproduces my setup, so I was surprised to find that the steps that produced my current system did not seem to work anymore
2016-01-14 23:24:22	edr	that's all.

2016-01-14 23:26:12	duncaen	xbps-query -m to get all manual installed packages and then you can pass the list to mklive.sh from https://github.com/voidlinux/void-mklive
2016-01-14 23:28:59	maldridge	edr: the standalone binaries are only meant to be used if you aren't using void as your boot media.  The normall installer does not use them
2016-01-14 23:29:55	edr	Aha!
2016-01-14 23:30:14	edr	Thanks to you both. These are two pieces of interesting information
2016-01-14 23:30:58	maldridge	np, its somewhat more advanced to install from static bins, that's mainly just if there's something that prevents you from booting the default hybridized iso
2016-01-14 23:31:23	edr	Ok, I see.
2016-01-14 23:31:46	edr	So for the record xbps-pkgdb -a does not fix the missing symlinks in bin
2016-01-14 23:32:37	duncaen	hm then xbps-alternatives -l
2016-01-14 23:32:38	maldridge	no, it doesn't; you need to actually install the alternatives system because those symlinks are managed by xbps-alternatives
2016-01-14 23:32:54	duncaen	and then set all alternatives manually :s
2016-01-14 23:33:31	edr	ok. I don't think I am going to try this. If the new iso gets this done the right way that's obviously the better way

2016-01-15 21:24:56	jumblemuddle	It is indeed in the makefile... gnu-makefile is set as my build_style. :/
2016-01-15 21:25:20	hbekel	jumblemuddle: usually one would use sed to edit the Makefile from the template prior to building
2016-01-15 21:26:11	hbekel	jumblemuddle: see the lilo template for example
2016-01-15 21:26:15	jumblemuddle	I did notice 'sed -i 's/^\(CFLAGS *+=\)/override \1/' Makefile' in there, but I can't make heads or tails of it.
2016-01-15 21:26:21	jumblemuddle	Alright, will do. Thanks
2016-01-15 21:27:12	Ypnose	or write a tiny patch in /patches if you are lazy
2016-01-15 21:27:34	dominikh	or fix upstream
2016-01-15 21:28:56	jumblemuddle	I don't think it's an upstream issue, as the flags are set in the makefile. Is that sed command I posted the issue? I have no experience with sed.
2016-01-15 21:29:41	Ypnose	s|^I don't think|You should think|g'
2016-01-15 21:30:20	jumblemuddle	Why should I think it is?
2016-01-15 21:31:28	Ypnose	was a tiny joke
2016-01-15 21:31:38	jumblemuddle	Oh, ok. :)
2016-01-15 21:33:18	jumblemuddle	So, removing that sed command from pre_build() doesn't help. The makefile's CFLAGS are still used.
2016-01-15 21:33:48	Ypnose	(just waiting for my smoked salmon to be ready, don't pay attention to my stupidity)
2016-01-15 21:34:10	dominikh	Ypnose: it's difficult not to
2016-01-15 21:34:33	Ypnose	what a sniper! :O
2016-01-15 21:34:45	Ypnose	2016 is the no-troll year
2016-01-15 21:34:46	dominikh	jumblemuddle: link to the thing you're trying to package?
2016-01-15 21:35:25	jumblemuddle	https://github.com/krypt-n/bar frok of the lemonbar that is already in repo.
2016-01-15 21:35:27	jumblemuddle	fork*
2016-01-15 21:36:07	dominikh	and you're trying to build the v1.0 release from march 2014? or the master branch?
2016-01-15 21:36:21	jumblemuddle	v1.0
2016-01-15 21:36:32	Ypnose	oh dang, I edited that Makefile one day
2016-01-15 21:36:51	dominikh	isn't v1.0 still the pre-fork state
2016-01-15 21:37:30	dominikh	yep.
2016-01-15 21:37:34	dominikh	v1.0 is the original lemonbar
2016-01-15 21:37:39	jumblemuddle	Uh, that's possible. How would I go about using the master branch?
2016-01-15 21:37:44	jumblemuddle	master forked branch*
2016-01-15 21:38:12	dominikh	grep srcpkgs/ for _commit and look at the templates that pull specific revisions
2016-01-15 21:38:24	jumblemuddle	Alright, will do.
2016-01-15 21:38:31	dominikh	also, just to be clear upfront: this is something you're just packaging for yourself, right? not intended to be contributed to void-packages
2016-01-15 21:38:45	jumblemuddle	Yeah, I'm just wanting to use it myself.
2016-01-15 21:38:56	jumblemuddle	I'm not nearly experienced enough to contribute. :P
2016-01-15 21:39:10	dominikh	(I'm asking/saying because we wouldn't accept that package for various reasons)
2016-01-15 21:39:28	dominikh	I do not understand how you can get build failures though when you're trying to build the exact same thing that the original template already builds
2016-01-15 21:40:12	jumblemuddle	Well, the fork adds xft support, and apparently there's a cflag that needs to be set? -lxcb, I'm not really sure.
2016-01-15 21:40:22	dominikh	yes, but you weren't trying to build the fork.
2016-01-15 21:40:24	dominikh	v1.0 isn't the fork
2016-01-15 21:40:38	jumblemuddle	Oh, yeah... I'm stumped then.
2016-01-15 21:40:56	dominikh	well okay, we build v1.1, not v1.0 – who knows what changed.
2016-01-15 21:44:12	dominikh	https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar/issues/9#issuecomment-151045636 lol
2016-01-15 21:44:46	dominikh	I'm tempted to post a +1 on it because he forgot to lock the issue :>

2016-01-15 22:07:09	chris2	and which archs would you like?
2016-01-15 22:08:44	gattuso	subpkg so is synced with main gdb. I think having a remote gdb for all the main arch we compile at least, so we could remote debug our builds.
2016-01-15 22:09:03	gattuso	wow, much english, so awesome
2016-01-15 22:09:05	gattuso	no sleep

2016-01-15 22:12:17	chris2	perhaps avr
