2016-01-16 15:16:48	vegardx	[04:58:32] And current documentation with using self-signed certificates doesn't really add any security. It would make sense to make the documentation reflect that.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	anhtuann	[05:38:44] I'm fiddling with weechat settings. Is there a way to just revert a setting to default using /set ?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	strayPuppy	[05:39:25] anhtuann: use  /unset
2016-01-16 15:16:48	anhtuann	[05:40:37] thanks strayPuppy !
2016-01-16 15:16:48	strayPuppy	[05:40:42] no problem :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	anhtuann	[05:51:25] I must say, I'm really impressed with weechat. Pretty new to the IRC scene though. The doc is really well done
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Alissa	[05:51:49] !quickstart anhtuann - you might find this useful

2016-01-16 15:16:48	anhtuann	[05:53:17] Yes, Alissa, I followed this doc already. Trying to understand smart filter at the moment

2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:16:05] Hey
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:16:11] I was gonna ask something, then I forgot.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:16:14] :(
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:16:43] Oh yeah, how do I select text inside only the buffer of text but not timstamp and | and nicklistg and all that
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:16:45] urxvt
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:17:04] and also, how can I select/copy/paste text w/o having to use shift key in weedchat
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:17:15] I can use not shift key in eveyrwhere else
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gb	[07:17:24] !triggers for timestamp trigger then /key bind meta-t /toggle_time %l:%M:%S

2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:17:39] who me?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:17:43] this for me?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gb	[07:17:46] or you could /iset bare and use bare mode to set timestamp off
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:18:01] I want timstamps but I don't want to copy it w/ mouse
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:18:27] also nicklist and | and just you know, multi line copy like urxvt does, but I dunno
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:18:32] you know what I  mean?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:18:43] I know what I mean, but I can't explain it
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:18:45] sorry
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gb	[07:19:08] you want to selectthe text with timestamp and magically remove them from the third party paste buffer
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:19:16] no
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:19:18] not magically
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:19:26] but with technology

2016-01-16 15:16:48	singalaut	[07:19:46] stoned: Disable weechat’s mouse support (alt+m) if you hate having to press shift. Urxvt has rectangular selection with alt+drag (or alt+shift+drag if your weechat mouse is enabled)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:19:52] how can i copy this w/ proper formatting
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:20:02] like no | and no line returns in odd places
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:20:08] Do you know what I mean?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:20:21] singalaut: oh awesome, ty
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gb	[07:20:27] i guess you could make a script top sed remove all the numbers from the selected text but no clue how
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:20:39] oh
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:20:41] hmm
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gb	[07:21:38] the box works with most terms but i forgot bout it
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:21:47] This also causes problems in copying urls or multi lines anything
2016-01-16 15:16:48	stoned	[07:21:49] :(
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gb	[07:22:39] yup but baremode can be setup to switch the ncurses, etc off
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gb	[07:23:03] so scroll to bit you want bare mode vut with mouse
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gb	[07:26:51] the box select will also break in certain macish stuff due to insane alt key configurations
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gb	[07:28:00] not much you can do about the wrapping/line feeds though using it
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@FlashCode	[07:50:07] stoned: alt-l (L) for bare display
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@FlashCode	[07:51:52] there you can click on long URLs and copy text

2016-01-16 15:16:48	Alissa	[08:31:31] Hook up phone to WeeChat relay and wait for it to ding :v
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Alissa	[08:31:41] that's what I use.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@FlashCode	[08:32:23] anhtuann: there's a default "beep" trigger, that makes a terminal alert by default, but you can run any external command if needed
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@FlashCode	[08:32:30] using /exec
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@FlashCode	[08:32:39] or you can install a script, at your choice
2016-01-16 15:16:48	nyuszika7h	[10:34:14] how do I check for a highlight in a modifier (weechat_print, but if there's another I can use (for privmsgs), that's ok too)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	nyuszika7h	[10:34:49] ${tg_highlight} doesn't work with the modifier
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@FlashCode	[10:43:13] nyuszika7h: you can not detect a highlight in a modifier because the modifier is executed before looking for highlight
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@FlashCode	[10:43:27] the changed string can become or not be a highlight any more
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@FlashCode	[10:43:45] you know if it's a highlight only when the message is displayed
2016-01-16 15:16:48	nyuszika7h	[10:44:05] well, a friend wants to color the message in red for highlights
2016-01-16 15:16:48	nyuszika7h	[10:44:11] how could I do that?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@FlashCode	[10:45:19] good question, colorize_lines.pl does not do that?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	nyuszika7h	[10:46:02] that just uses the nick color for all messages
2016-01-16 15:16:48	andi_	[11:07:37] hello i have a question, if i get long urls in weechat it seems like i get a glitch and the chat lines overlap each other, how can i fix this? i already set weechat.look glitch to off
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@nils_2	[11:19:16] try /window bare
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@nils_2	[11:21:57] nyuszika7h, he can improve script (with new option) to display highlight message with a given color instead of nick color
2016-01-16 15:16:48	nyuszika7h	[11:22:27] she, and I would be the one to do it, as she doesn't know much programming :P but either way I can try
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@nils_2	[11:28:58] but for highlights colorize_lines is using the weechat.color.chat_highlight* option. isn't it a solution for her to simply use red in this option?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Petzku	[11:32:43] FlashCode: is it possible to color the word/words that caused a highlight in a message?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@nils_2	[11:33:53] should be possible with a script or a trigger
2016-01-16 15:16:48	iotre	[11:40:41] /filter add slack irc.slack.* irc_mode (\+|\-)v
2016-01-16 15:16:48	iotre	[11:40:53] Doesn't do anything..
2016-01-16 15:16:48	iotre	[12:16:13] actually filters don't work at all it seems
2016-01-16 15:16:48	iotre	[12:16:19] /filter add delmee *#weechat irc_join *
2016-01-16 15:16:48	iotre	[12:16:37] I shouldn't see a joins here now, right? But I do
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@FlashCode	[12:18:39] iotre: try to enable filters: alt+'='
2016-01-16 15:16:48	iotre	[12:21:16] FlashCode: ..oh, thanks. I did do /filter toggle a bunch of times before but somehow that did it just now
2016-01-16 15:16:48	iotre	[12:21:20] :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	synthmeat	[13:01:03] there aren't any docs around for bitlbee-facebook. anyone using this?

2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[13:52:58] hey. does anyone know if /go script has an autocompletion or alternative script with autocompleteion when I for instance type /go archli and hit tab and it autocomplets to /go archlinux?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@nils_2	[13:59:00] why not using /buffer #archli[tab] then instead of /go?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[13:59:16] oh, didn't know that i could do that with /buffer
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[13:59:19] thanks.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[13:59:41] i can essentially
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[13:59:45] uninstall /go now :p
2016-01-16 15:16:48	wlhlm	[14:00:46] Ashley_: oops, I just noticed you were asking for a specific server, I missed that.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Ashley_	[14:21:49] It's okay, i managed to modify that command to match only that server's buffers

2016-01-16 16:49:05	wadadli	Also how can I group channels by their servers?
2016-01-16 16:49:27	@nils_2	wadadli, you have to bind a key to page up/down the buffers-bar. command is /bar scroll buffers * y-100%
2016-01-16 16:49:37	Lukas_	oups wrong language sorry ... for exemple .iset freenode.autojoin #weechat,#archlinux ?
2016-01-16 16:49:46	@nils_2	and y+100% for other direction of course
2016-01-16 16:50:30	@nils_2	wadadli, /buffer move and then /layout store
2016-01-16 16:50:46	@nils_2	for new opened channels use /iset irc.look.new_channel_position
2016-01-16 16:51:44	wlhlm	Lukas_: there is an official #weechar-fr channel, if you're more comfortable with French :)
2016-01-16 16:51:50	wadadli	I'm meant to move the buffer where?

2016-01-16 16:54:34	wadadli	lol
2016-01-16 16:56:46	@nils_2	andering, you can use command "/mode -i" to make you "visible" but also nickserv should have this flag server side (can someone confirm?)
2016-01-16 16:56:50	wadadli	Could you send me that cmd to move the buffer.pl down and up by the way

2016-01-16 17:00:17	Alissa	a comma.
2016-01-16 17:00:53	Daimaah	in the /server add?
2016-01-16 17:00:59	Alissa	Yes.
2016-01-16 17:01:18	Daimaah	ah, i'll just have to remove the server first apparently, can't add new ones to an existing one
