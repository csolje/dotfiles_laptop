2015-11-05 00:09:57	blaine	okay, thanks. I installed Leap 42.1 XFCE just now and have been having issues with DNS. After installation, Network Manager applet wasn't working so I opened YAST and went to the service manager and disabled wicked, enabled NetworkManager, and rebooted. When it came back, the applet was now working so I connected to my wifi and tried to run a zypper up and I got a curl error saying software.opensuse.org was unreachable. So I pinged
2015-11-05 00:09:57	blaine	8.8.8.8 and it was successful, however www.google.com was unsuccessful. I tried hardcoding my router's ip as a DNS server in NetworkManager. Didn't work. Tried hardcoding 8.8.8.8 (google dns) still didn't work. Any ideas?

2015-11-06 18:32:09	leba2	Er, sirs, sorry for insist, but I'd like to go back to openSUSE now that Leap has been released. But I have doubts. Shouldn't Flash be already kind of banned as well? Why the multimeda guide isn't updated any longer? Why isn't there a LiveDVD for Leap?
2015-11-06 18:33:19	Stallmanu	leba2: 1) Why should flash be banned? Some people still need it. Its entirely optional to install.
2015-11-06 18:33:54	Stallmanu	leba2: 2) Probably because there is a 1 click install now, if you would like you can message one of the admins and ask them to add the 1 click install to that thread?
2015-11-06 18:34:56	leba2	Isn't there a LiveDVD for Leap any longer?
2015-11-06 18:35:12	Stallmanu	leba2: 3) No one stepped up to maintain the live CDs, but you can make your own on SUSE Studio, or use someone elses! In fact you can customize it to be exactly how you want it as a live CD. The issue was really that there was no one who wanted to test and maintain the Live CD.
2015-11-06 18:35:28	leba2	Ooouuuccchh
2015-11-06 18:35:36	hemelskonijn	Mkey,... so far what i have found seems to indicate CPU throttling would work incorrectly if the PBLK length is not equal to 6 this seems to cause my CPU to be stuck @1200Mhz instead of its native 1400Mhz (C2D U9400). Since the only suggested fix is a BIOS update or running without ACPI i decided that for me running on 1200Mhz is good enough
2015-11-06 18:35:38	Stallmanu	leba2: keep in mind, it takes a lot of work to support the live CD
2015-11-06 18:35:50	hemelskonijn	thanks ya'll
2015-11-06 18:36:05	Stallmanu	leba2: and to be honest, you can build your own really easily on suse studio (plus lots of people have built them)

2015-11-06 18:37:36	leba2	Stallmanu: I was about to say that was a shitty shame because Live CD's are *always* useful, specially for rescue purposes. But since you insist Suse Studio is so easy to use that no one cared anymore about a "public" general Livd CD download...

2015-11-07 00:54:52	hemelskonijn	does any one here know how to throttle (or unthrottle) a CPU manually? (long story short i ran in to a PBLK length being incorrect issue [8] instead of 0 or 6 which has little implication other then my CPU not throttling over 1200Mhz (1400Mhz CPU) unless i switch off ACPI)
2015-11-07 00:55:27	hemelskonijn	I never really noticed any adverse effect of ignoring the error however now i know i would like my 200Mhz back :)

2015-11-07 20:28:01	deavmi_mobile	I recently installed openSusr Leap and I was checking out my repositories lost using Yast when I realised that the non-OSS repository was enabled, although during the installation I explicitly disabled the non-OSS repository. Why has this occurred though that after the install with the non-OSS repository removed and "Proprietary software" unchecked during installation configuration?

2015-11-07 20:28:02	deavmi_mobile	Could it be that openSuse scans hardware and searches for drivers and enables repos that it needs. Because I hate having non-OSS in my computer and don't want any of it. How can I disable such software (driver) installation, if any? I want openSuse but I don't want terrible things like proprietary software. Although the kernel is not libre Linux but besides that.

2015-11-08 12:49:25	weedmic	How can I set the default volume of various programmes in KDE4 on 13.2.  For example, I know if I try to play a word in google translate, it will play at like 90% and scare everyone in the room.  And after each sentence it resets to that volume.
2015-11-08 12:49:55	revealed	weedmic: check if you change volume for Master channel
2015-11-08 12:50:28	weedmic	yes, but it is not listed by programme - the closest I can see is java - which I don't think it is.

2015-11-08 13:00:44	revealed	if its still to loud you can also check yast soundcard settings theres something about basic volume. I tend to reduce soundcards output to like 90 percent. I have 200 watts rms subwoofer under table. All starts jumping
2015-11-08 13:01:11	weedmic	I found "volume overdrive" and unchecked that, but no change.

2015-11-08 17:14:02	GeeKoyo	How's #suse doing today,
2015-11-08 17:14:04	dupin	is it wise to install all those packages from pakman repo
2015-11-08 17:14:09	GeeKoyo	I'll be around if someone needs a bit of help
2015-11-08 17:14:12	Stallmanu	dupin: yeah, you can usually ignore this message, its not an error, its just telling you that another repo has a newer version of the package but zypper will not install it until you do a dup or change priorities
2015-11-08 17:14:36	dupin	so zypper dup will do it
2015-11-08 17:14:54	ananke	dupin: it simply means that packman repository has those packages, and they're newer than what you have. however, since packman is a different _vendor_, it's not going to consider them as possible upgrades
2015-11-08 17:14:56	dupin	I will try it
2015-11-08 17:14:58	Stallmanu	but no need to dup
2015-11-08 17:14:58	ananke	dupin: NO
2015-11-08 17:15:06	Stallmanu	no dont dup
2015-11-08 17:15:08	ananke	dupin: don't use dup.
2015-11-08 17:15:18	dupin	ok ananke
2015-11-08 17:15:36	ananke	dupin: dup should be reserved for system upgrades, or _very carefully planned_ vendor changes

2015-11-08 17:17:52	dupin	is that it
2015-11-08 17:18:06	GeeKoyo	dupin, always a nice check you can do is , zypper patch
2015-11-08 17:18:15	GeeKoyo	nothing wrong with patches :-)
2015-11-08 17:18:17	ananke	dupin: yes, and the newer ones are not from the same repo you have your current ones. so there are _no_ updates
2015-11-08 17:18:32	ananke	except zypper patch is different from zypper up
2015-11-08 17:18:44	dupin	they are probably from pakman repo witch I just added

2015-11-08 19:17:43	eronis_	hi
2015-11-08 19:18:28	mjayk	hay
2015-11-08 19:18:48	eronis_	I have some problems with steam maybe you could help me
2015-11-08 19:19:11	eronis_	openSUSE recommends btfs and
2015-11-08 19:19:21	eronis_	xfs file systems
2015-11-08 19:19:33	eronis_	https://en.opensuse.org/Steam#Game_crashes_even_with_STEAM_RUNTIME.3D0
2015-11-08 19:19:55	Stallmanu	some games have issues with xfs :(
2015-11-08 19:20:21	eronis_	So, can I just use ext4 for my home folder ?
2015-11-08 19:20:30	Stallmanu	yes
2015-11-08 19:20:45	eronis_	I guess using it on my root partition would be troublesome ?
2015-11-08 19:20:54	Stallmanu	no, its up to you
2015-11-08 19:20:59	eronis_	why exactly I should use btrfs ?
2015-11-08 19:21:05	eronis_	I'm a home user
2015-11-08 19:21:10	Stallmanu	btrfs is just the default because it can snapshot
2015-11-08 19:21:22	revealed	when you ask this question, i  think you dont need it.
2015-11-08 19:21:32	eronis_	So, I can use ext4 for all my computer ?

2015-11-08 19:22:14	Phazeus_tux	btrfs is shit
2015-11-08 19:22:21	eronis_	phazeus :D
2015-11-08 19:22:23	cousin_luigi	eronis_: I've been using ext4 for home and root for years. Not a crash, ever.
2015-11-08 19:22:26	Phazeus_tux	more stable is Ext4

2015-11-08 19:22:52	eronis_	ok, and one more think I would like to ask
2015-11-08 19:23:07	revealed	eronis_: The main benefit you would see is the Snapshot feature. The other benefits are not seen by normal hobby users.
2015-11-08 19:23:09	Phazeus_tux	eronis_,  use Ext4
2015-11-08 19:23:15	Stallmanu	Phazeus_tux: thats your opinion
2015-11-08 19:23:35	Phazeus_tux	and my friends who has use both
2015-11-08 19:23:44	Stallmanu	it works fine for me, has since 13.2.
2015-11-08 19:24:11	Stallmanu	eronis_: really its up to you, read up on its functionality, if you feel you dont need it then use ext4
2015-11-08 19:24:31	eronis_	revealed, I'm not a hobby user, I just wanna a operating system which is ultra stable, not having old packeges and secure (viruses)
2015-11-08 19:24:34	revealed	eronis_: btrfs by default only does snapshoot of /root --- if you want to e.g. have snapshots of home -- to recover you Libreoffice dokument of an hour ago. Then you would have to configure this.
2015-11-08 19:24:56	Stallmanu	PS: snapshots are not backups ;)
2015-11-08 19:25:01	revealed	But the configuration is not easy. You have to read into this.
2015-11-08 19:25:15	revealed	And i have seen ppl. fail restoring snapshots.
2015-11-08 19:26:01	eronis_	One more thing, why only opensuse has steam problem. I mean every time I want to play games I should write
2015-11-08 19:26:04	eronis_	STEAM_RUNTIME=0 steam
2015-11-08 19:26:35	revealed	Another --- point let me name it selten false positive. Or the case where the exceptions confirm the rule is my old T60 with an ultra old and slow notebook HDD. Has performance impact due to copy on write operations and the snapper processes.

2015-11-08 23:42:06	immotus	I see that OpenSUSE LEAP is expected to get updated packages from userland.. but keep a stable core.. are server-oriented packaged (eg. Apache/PHP) going to be updated like user-land packages will be, or will they stay stagnant?
2015-11-08 23:42:35	--	mkubecek is now known as _mkubecek_away
2015-11-08 23:45:19	immotus	I ask, because it sounds like LEAP would be perfect for running my owncloud server.. but I don't want to be stuck on an old version of PHP later in the year if OwnCloud decides to require a PHP upgrade again
2015-11-08 23:45:47	Stallmanu	there are supposed to be yearly service packs
2015-11-08 23:46:08	Stallmanu	so maybe those will have updates to PHP, cant say right now though I havent seen it discussed

2015-11-17 19:19:59	cue	Greetings. Am on opensuse Leap. When I try to copy a folder from another machine on the lan or from a camera card in the card reader of this laptop, to the laptop hard drive, I get a messasge saying: '<foldername> is a folder, but a file was expected.' and the folder is not copied. Anyone have any idea what might be causing this?

2015-11-19 01:31:26	Simotek-Work	personally i'd consider just downloading and installing the package manually, but then you wont get updates
2015-11-19 01:32:04	Ahmose757	you mean from rpm file?
2015-11-19 01:32:15	Simotek-Work	actually personally id fork the package into a user repo with my other unstable packages and enable that repo

2015-11-20 21:52:34	Stallmanu	dont log in to the gui as root
2015-11-20 21:53:06	Stallmanu	if you need to run certain applications as root you can use "kdesu"
2015-11-20 21:53:47	benvla	Stallmanu: I know, I know. But still like to get this fixed
2015-11-20 21:54:31	Stallmanu	maybe PA isnt setup/like to run for root user? Does it work for other users?
2015-11-20 21:55:09	benvla	Stallmanu: Yes for 'regular' users it does work.
2015-11-20 21:55:21	Stallmanu	so why do you need it as root
2015-11-20 21:56:08	benvla	Stallmanu: To be honest, I always logged in as root in version 13.2 and no problems for the audio part.

2015-11-20 21:56:40	Stallmanu	cant say why, maybe something changed in newer version but either way you shouldnt run the whole gui as root
2015-11-20 21:56:55	Stallmanu	just use kdesu to run the individual program that you need for root access
2015-11-20 21:57:56	revealed	I would not dare to run desktop as root.

2015-11-20 21:58:48	benvla	Stallmanu: read a lot about not logging in as root, but it still isn't really clear why not. Damiging my system is restored within 3 minutes wit fsarchiver.
2015-11-20 21:59:35	Stallmanu	because every program you run will have root access, including any scripts or addons you use. Even your web browser....
2015-11-20 22:00:17	Stallmanu	if any of them have a reasonable vulnerability/bug you could end up giving an attacker root access into your box
2015-11-20 22:00:34	Stallmanu	reasonable -> "medium severity"

2015-11-21 22:48:38	Robitron	a recap:  The original problem was that I couldn't play videos from crackle.com.  (it said I needed the most up to date version of adobe flash) so I came in here and asked for help.

2015-11-21 22:51:06	Robitron	long story short, after updating flash player didn't work and changing to freshplayer gave the same unsatisfying result, we realized that crackle doesn't work with linux.  but now, I can't get any videos to play on firefox at all...

2015-11-22 23:02:08	kuter	hehe actually I've got question about kdm .. why there is a difference between kdm login screen and kde screen when I for example lock the screen ?
2015-11-22 23:02:15	Phazeus_tux	JenaPlinsky,   I has not nead KDE machine :(

2015-11-22 23:03:03	JenaPlinsky	Guys thanks a lot ;)
2015-11-22 23:03:18	Stallmanu	kuter: I suspect because one is the SDDM theme and the other is the KDE lock screen theme

2015-11-22 23:04:07	Moleboy	Hey guys, my CPU automatically downclocks itself to around 800-900mhz, and it's slowing me down. It theoretically upclocks when it needs to, but the switchover wait is frustrating. Any way to force it to run at full speed 100% of the time?

It functions OK like that.  But something during zypper upgrades undoes the work and splits all the grouped pkgs into individual rules.  So instead of a few organized groups I have many individual rules.

2015-11-26 21:06:07	microchip_	nightfuri: not saying that. But XFS is targeted at Enterprise, HPC, Big Data storage and stuff. Follow the XFS maillist and see for yourself, or ask Dave in #xfs :)
2015-11-26 21:06:09	Mo	I just remember XFS had advantage for large files. For daily use with average files and no subvolumes I would still recommend ext4 over XFS, bust just my opinion.
2015-11-26 21:06:22	mark761	When I was using PC-BSD they switched to a filing system that required a minimum of 4GB to run.  I forget if it was XFS or ZFS.  Clearly it must the latter

2015-11-26 21:26:28	eadthem_tab	not sure how that happend.  but how hard is that going to be to move to 64bit

2015-11-27 00:16:01	regedit	i'm starting to suspect my dowanload and/or burning of the DVD may not have been done well, so i'm redownloading the ISO and i'm noticing my previous download had a timestamp like 20151123 in it, whereas now it just says "Current" in the file name

2015-11-28 01:46:34	Phazeus_tux	Robitron,   ok, what repo address you want to replace to mirror?
2015-11-28 01:46:40	Robitron	zypper lr -uP | susepaste will get me the one I need?
2015-11-28 01:46:50	Robitron	I don't know what one is the best one.  lol
2015-11-28 01:46:59	Stallmanu	no I want to see your urls, I am doubting you are using the europe links
2015-11-28 01:47:00	Phazeus_tux	lol
2015-11-28 01:47:27	Stallmanu	that command will spit out a link, paste the link here
2015-11-28 01:47:34	Robitron	and do I need to automatically change each http for each repo to that new mirror?  and also, what if a repo I have is not supported from that mirror?
2015-11-28 01:47:39	Stallmanu	I want to first check to see if you are using the generic link
2015-11-28 01:47:57	Phazeus_tux	Robitron,    possible do it easy in cli :)
2015-11-28 01:48:11	Stallmanu	Robitron: all the default repos should be supported by the mirrors
2015-11-28 01:48:19	Robitron	the paste failed...
2015-11-28 01:49:02	Stallmanu	zypper lr -uP, take the output and paste on pastebin.com

2015-11-28 01:50:23	Robitron	Okay so I try to paste it to paste.opensuse.org/ and it says I'm a spammer!

2015-11-28 01:51:18	Robitron	http://pastebin.com/YNitFuWA
2015-11-28 01:51:54	Robitron	but why did it call me a spammer?  is it because I was trying to paste too much info at one time?
2015-11-28 01:52:01	Stallmanu	you are already using the generic links, mirror brain should give you the best link
2015-11-28 01:52:13	Stallmanu	Robitron: yea, paste.opensuse.org is weird :P
2015-11-28 01:52:59	Robitron	According to revealed, when he/she hopped on my pc to help me with some issues, my mirror is in Germany (I think).
2015-11-28 01:53:13	Stallmanu	only packman
2015-11-28 01:54:15	Stallmanu	http://packman.inode.at/suse/ should show you the best mirror
2015-11-28 01:54:18	Robitron	Okay, here's the issue.  I'm trying to watch movies but almost everyone of them say that my browser (firefox, chromium or chrome) does not support protected content or something like that.
2015-11-28 01:54:56	Phazeus_tux	robertf,    install    libhal1-flash
2015-11-28 01:55:03	Phazeus_tux	and clear cache
2015-11-28 01:55:09	Robitron	I went to the site that hosts the videos (rabbit tv - not a hack or pirate site) and chatted with them on their support line and they said that it it's strange that I'm getting this error since I'm in the U.S.
2015-11-28 01:55:38	Stallmanu	Robitron: try as Phazeus_tux suggested, you need that library + flash
2015-11-28 01:55:43	Phazeus_tux	Robitron, ^^
2015-11-28 01:56:02	Phazeus_tux	flash 11.2  (freshplayer not works)
2015-11-28 01:56:05	Robitron	cache is clear and what is lbihal1-flash?  because I've already installed adobe flash player and freshplayer and neither of them worked.
2015-11-28 01:56:27	Robitron	so type zypper in libhal1-flash ?
2015-11-28 01:56:42	Phazeus_tux	find it on    software.opensuse.org
2015-11-28 01:56:55	Stallmanu	https://software.opensuse.org/package/libhal1-flash
2015-11-28 01:57:00	Phazeus_tux	:)
2015-11-28 01:57:18	Stallmanu	best solution would be to not use flash :)
2015-11-28 01:57:36	Phazeus_tux	нуы)
2015-11-28 01:57:38	Phazeus_tux	yes)
2015-11-28 01:58:14	Robitron	I tried without flash and couldn't even get video to work, it was an infite load.
2015-11-28 01:59:00	Stallmanu	well yeah for that site, but I'm saying in general if you avoid flash you will be better off
2015-11-28 01:59:08	Robitron	so was that "yes" to my question about typing zypper in software.opensuse.org ?  because when I click the link, the only thing that shows up for 13.1 is a link to show unstable versions and I'm already unstable enough, I don't need my pc to be unstable too!  lol
2015-11-28 01:59:14	Phazeus_tux	Robitron,   install and delete FlashPlayer cache in home and try. If nor works, disable freshplayer (19 version) and use 11.2 flash
2015-11-28 02:00:04	Stallmanu	Robitron: You need to use that repo, just set its priority to be low
2015-11-28 02:01:03	Robitron	I don't know how to do this stuff.  <sigh>
2015-11-28 02:01:08	Stallmanu	ok
2015-11-28 02:01:21	Phazeus_tux	дуфкт ж)
2015-11-28 02:01:26	Phazeus_tux	learn ;)
2015-11-28 02:01:32	Phazeus_tux	may be VNC?
2015-11-28 02:01:47	Robitron	it's been over a year since I started with suse and still can't get this.  :(
2015-11-28 02:01:58	Phazeus_tux	ok :)
2015-11-28 02:02:07	Stallmanu	you can try VNC with Phazeus_tux

2015-11-28 02:29:57	Stallmanu	blender is not easy to learn if you know any other animation software ;)
2015-11-28 02:30:15	Robitron	also, #blender is the official chat room for blender.  thay are really helpful there.  ;)

2015-11-28 18:20:54	Stallmanu	alejandro: sure, the issue as I see it is that Mint as the host can see the hardware because it is directly connected. For a virtual machine to see hardware from the host you have to perform a passthrough with that hardware (usually you can do this using the VM management software).

2015-11-28 21:43:29	tacit	ShalokShalom: No, no rolling.
2015-11-28 21:44:24	tacit	ShalokShalom: It's a stable release. So security and bug fixes only, usually by backporting or staying on the same stable upstream branch.
2015-11-28 21:44:31	Celestine	minor releases ~annually and major every 3-4 years
2015-11-28 21:44:52	ShalokShalom	tacit: whats about the kernel ?
2015-11-28 21:44:54	ShalokShalom	x11 ?
2015-11-28 21:44:59	IngeSv	FYI It was my Anti Virus software (Ad-Aware Free Anti Virus) that made my downloads of Leap and Tumbleweed with Firefox (or Google Chrome) to fail.
2015-11-28 21:45:08	tacit	ShalokShalom: Same. s-t-a-b-l-e.
2015-11-28 21:45:09	ShalokShalom	i read, they get changed each 18 months or so ?
2015-11-28 21:45:13	Stallmanu	!stable
2015-11-28 21:45:13	SUSEhelp	"stable" means different things to people. In the GNU/Linux world, it means a release is complete and does not change except for bug fixes. openSUSE Leap releases are stable, Tumbleweed is not because it is changing. The other meaning is "does not crash". The likelyhood of that is reduced by using "stable" releases. Given that, you may wish to clarify your question regarding "stable".
2015-11-28 21:45:17	ShalokShalom	ok, then was this wrong info
2015-11-28 21:45:37	edogawa	ShalokShalom: that would be a new release then, probably (didn't read up yet)

2015-11-28 21:48:46	Celestine	maybe new kernel or apps, updates, but minor ones
2015-11-28 21:49:10	tacit	ShalokShalom: https://en.opensuse.org/Lifetime
2015-11-28 21:49:38	tacit	ShalokShalom: you need to go to .2 within 6 months.
2015-11-28 21:49:40	Celestine	no you have a 6months window opportunity to update to the latest minor release
2015-11-28 21:50:07	Celestine	so support for every release is up to 18 months
2015-11-28 21:50:11	tacit	ShalokShalom: However if you consider how the upgrades between SLE Service Packs work, it will be rather smooth.

2015-11-30 04:29:58	Stallmanu	My suggestion to you is upgrade to Tumbleweed or at least Leap/13.2 if you want to use the latest version of blender. 13.1 doesnt even have an up to date python3 package so it seems very very difficult if not impossible to package
2015-11-30 04:30:28	Stallmanu	Blender 2.76 seems to need python 3.4 but 13.1 seems to be on 3.3
2015-11-30 04:31:09	Stallmanu	If you stick with 13.1 then try asking about the error in #blender, it seems to be some issue with two plugins having the same name in their config
2015-11-30 04:31:12	Roan	okay, so how do I do that?  :/

2015-11-30 04:32:49	Simotek-Work	!upgrade
2015-11-30 04:32:49	SUSEhelp	You can do a live distribution upgrade with openSUSE.  Valid releases are from 10.3 and up.  You can find a how-to here: http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:System_upgrade
2015-11-30 04:32:54	Stallmanu	Roan: my real question though, do you need the latest blender version?
2015-11-30 04:33:32	Roan	I can go back to 2.75 for now but blender upgrades rather quickly.
2015-11-30 04:33:44	Mir	Roan: if you need the latest blender ... our local blender expert has one suggestion.... compile it yourself

2015-11-30 14:49:53	Michael1969	general question: Is there any logic / systematic behind the several starting mechanisms of "services"?? E.g.: Apache's "httpd" daemon is started with "systemctl start apache2.service". Whereas tomcat, Apache's servlet engine, is started with "service tomcat start". This is awfully confusing for newbies, and any explanation might help :-)
2015-11-30 14:50:16	ananke	Michael1969: systemctl start tomcat
2015-11-30 14:50:24	howi	service, rcXXX, /etc/init.d/xxx are deprecated in favour of systemd, systemd rules!

2015-11-30 17:08:11	alvin	I guess I can disable that. The question is: will it work? Or is hplip something that will be backported anyway? It can wait a bit.

2015-11-30 17:59:45	timorL	After changing my system from the old grub to grub2 it is now booting using grub2.  When I look to the system with the 'bootinfoscript', it tells that grub2 is installed on this system in BOTH the /dev/sda MBR, and in the 'boot drive' partition, /dev/sda1.
2015-11-30 18:00:06	timorL	I bleieve it is best to only have one.  I have read over the help, and do not know which decision is best?
2015-11-30 18:00:31	timorL	Should I use the MBR or the BootDevice to place the Grub2 installation?

2015-11-30 18:00:59	Mir	on some of my systems they refuse to boot if something else is on the MBR
2015-11-30 18:01:19	Mir	timorL: likely your MBR had grubLegacy installed
2015-11-30 18:01:37	Mir	and without installing Grub2 your system would look at the mbr first
2015-11-30 18:01:43	timorL	Mir: It does have the grub 0.97 legacy version installed.
2015-11-30 18:01:58	timorL	So uysing the Yast installer for the bootloader, it asks where to install it.

2015-11-30 18:02:24	Mir	it has taken me 10 years to wonder why the default install of just having grub install to /boot failed to find a OS
2015-11-30 18:02:38	Mir	timorL: both
2015-11-30 18:02:47	Mir	i do both

2015-11-30 18:03:30	Mir	fresh new drived dont need that
2015-11-30 18:03:42	timorL	Then when you make changes to the grub config do you need something special to do? SO that both locations are updated?

2015-11-30 22:36:35	intrbiz	pilne: Leap, takes core / base functionality from SLES, so is very stable at the lowlevel, but allows newer packages on top, and has IIRC a 3 year support cycle

2015-12-01 23:27:52	vibe	Operation not permitted

2015-12-01 23:28:56	revealed	Psi-Jack: at least i hope so... or i will ask you from now if i need that worst case szenario help.
2015-12-01 23:29:12	dis7ant	vibe: Windows will often try to "sleep" or "hibernate" instead of actually shutting down like you want, when this happens it's not safe to mess with that filesystem
2015-12-01 23:29:43	dis7ant	likewise, if you cut power instead of doing a graceful shutdown of widows the same thing will happen.
2015-12-01 23:30:00	vibe	dis7ant:  How ?? i just shut down win10  normaly
2015-12-01 23:30:08	dis7ant	vibe: that's not the only thing that can cause the issue, but it's the first thing I usually check

2015-12-01 23:30:34	Psi-Jack	Heh, OS as a Service, Microsoft's latest OS model. Do you want to subscribe to your OS? Guess what. Windows 10 will basically be that way soon enough. ;)
2015-12-01 23:30:48	dis7ant	thanks Psi-Jack
2015-12-01 23:31:04	revealed	vibe: Theres different methods to shutdown windows. (generally). And if you do not fully shut it down. Linux finds hibernation images and complains about.
2015-12-01 23:31:22	Psi-Jack	dis7ant: Heh, for what?
2015-12-01 23:31:40	revealed	So the workaround this issue is to disable hybrid shutdown in windows. Or be sure to fully shut it down before booting linux.
2015-12-01 23:31:42	dis7ant	Psi-Jack: exactly ;)

2015-12-02 00:20:23	Psi-Jack	So, I had subvolumes for /home, /usr/local, /var/lib/{mysql,pgsql}, etc... /boot on an ext4 just like openSUSE does, etc..
2015-12-02 00:20:36	Psi-Jack	I had to manually go in and chattr +C things to stop COW, but otherwise..
2015-12-02 00:21:10	Psi-Jack	No, problem is specifically openSUSE LEAP, so far. I'm burning Tumbleweed now, to see if that problem exists still.
2015-12-02 00:21:10	pilne	i've done a single-partition (all brtfs, letting the installer setup whatever subvolumes it wanted) and multibooted it fine.
2015-12-02 00:21:22	pilne	13.2 worked?
2015-12-02 00:21:31	Psi-Jack	openSUSE LEAP 42.1 worked perfectly in a KVM guest instance.
2015-12-02 00:21:47	Psi-Jack	Never did 13.2. I don't want to do 13.2.

2015-12-02 00:22:29	Psi-Jack	Different installation setup methods, minor changes mostly.
2015-12-02 00:22:48	Psi-Jack	All using the auto-partitioning methods, not manual. I didn;'t want manual setup. ;)
2015-12-02 00:23:03	microchip_	hmm
2015-12-02 00:23:13	Psi-Jack	So, LEAP's very own installer fails on bare metal.
2015-12-02 00:23:17	microchip_	maybe that's the problem?
2015-12-02 00:23:36	Psi-Jack	A problem in openSUSE LEAP's pre-defined defaults? If so, where is the bug? Not me.

2015-12-03 01:26:48	jubalh	pilne, yep some things dont have a lightweight Qt alternative
2015-12-03 01:27:00	jubalh	I decided to use the xfce things in this case
2015-12-03 01:27:59	Simotek-Work	are they applications or extra wm components?
2015-12-03 01:28:24	pilne	ahh, so the pattern is the best way to do things in general
2015-12-03 01:28:26	pilne	ZYPPER TIME!
2015-12-03 01:28:27	jubalh	Unfortunately it is hard to server every users preferred case. For example, I myself, want a KDE free system and but I like minimal Qt apps. That's why I use LXQt and everywhere where there is not solution (I think networkmanager has no Qt frontend for example)? I try to find something..
2015-12-03 01:28:44	jubalh	pilne, yes the pattern is a good way to get all the lxqt stuff
2015-12-03 01:28:59	jubalh	pilne, you could also take a look at what the pattern wants to install and jus tinstall it by hand
2015-12-03 01:29:17	jubalh	in which case you could decide not to use the xfce things and use your KDE favourites instead
2015-12-03 01:29:37	Simotek-Work	yeah enlightenment still installs a gtk based NetworkManager frontend
2015-12-03 01:29:44	pilne	eh, i'd rather start with something that "just works" and then remove/add.. i'm not very awesome at suse yet, managed to bork up a lot of ubuntu installers
2015-12-03 01:29:49	jubalh	Simotek-Work, things like networkmanager, password manager etc if i remember correctly, maybe clipboard
2015-12-03 01:29:49	pilne	*installs
2015-12-03 01:29:59	pilne	but i want absolutely, positively 100% nothing to fuggin do with mir
2015-12-03 01:30:16	Simotek-Work	well running openSUSE your almost certain to get that
2015-12-03 01:30:47	Simotek-Work	if your running tumbleweed soon you might be able to try enlightenment with wayland
2015-12-03 01:30:59	jubalh	pilne, its no problem, take your time. anyways it would just be a 'zypper in -t pattern lxqt' which would give you a list of packages that are going to be isntalled and then cancel that, and do a 'zypper in PASTETHENAMEOFPACKAGES'
2015-12-03 01:31:06	pilne	yeup (: fedora felt too hipster to me (not that it is bad) and i'm not really a gnome3/2 guy, debian... freezes suck, arch... i don't want to fiddle much, and... gentoo....

But it worked and eventually everything was routed properly.  Now I just did a fresh install last week of leap.  And, usin gopenvpn, it'll connect, and I'll make some routing changes but it doesn't route properly

2015-12-03 23:44:58	pilne	i'll just try to re-run grub, maybe it was just a bit off due to running from the installer
2015-12-03 23:45:46	pilne	well, it didn't recognize it as "ubuntu" like it did the time it worked (although it is on a btrfs partition this time) and it won't boot into it (can't find the kernel) even though i installed it before tumbleweed and it was working fine right before i installed tumbleweed
2015-12-03 23:46:18	Celestine	maybe you can edit bootloader to probe foreign os's ?
2015-12-03 23:47:06	Phazeus_tux	pilne,  not use shit btrfs, or make separate /boot with Ext3/4

2015-12-04 21:18:36	Phazeus_tux	Simotek,   with ifup was not such issues like with wicked. May be it was too new and has issues... But this case why it was addaded, if it still not stable?
2015-12-04 21:18:52	Phazeus_tux	And NM by default better.
2015-12-04 21:19:09	Stallmanu	I can agree with that, I prefer NM
2015-12-04 21:19:43	Simotek	The only time i played with PPPoE recently was when i had to make it possible to dial into a debian box, and i haven't seen the dns issues, maybe something special about my systems

2015-12-05 22:31:52	Stallmanu	No I think it would be better to give 5 on the share, then 7 to the group/user on the directory they own inside the share
2015-12-05 22:32:15	Stallmanu	if you give 7 on the share they can move other peoples directories and direct them to harmful files

2015-12-05 22:35:10	Stallmanu	The point is a user can manipulate the root of the share directory since they all have write permission to it. This is why you never give 777 permissions to anything
2015-12-05 22:35:23	Stallmanu	Unles you are absolutely sure that it is okay

2015-12-05 22:36:11	Stallmanu	And if the root of the dir can be modified then they can rename the old dir and make a new one that emulates the original but with their harmful data instead
2015-12-05 22:37:15	Stallmanu	So it would be better to try and figure out what permissions you need instead

2015-12-06 01:28:00	milosz96	Hi all. I have desktop PC with gtx680, i7 3770 and suse leap42.1. I want to use intel integrated gpu for rendering desktop and gtx for cuda. I've forced using iGPU in bios and kde doesn't start (it throw me back to SDDM login screen, saying that 'could not start kmserver'. What could I do?
2015-12-06 01:29:03	milosz96	I tried pci-stub'ing gtx, with it kde started correctly, but i wasn't able to install nvidia drivers, because the gtx was pci-stub'ed

2015-12-06 06:45:37	AndChat107604	no I did not install grub at all, I was under the impression that the installer took care of that
2015-12-06 06:45:44	AndChat107604	so Im guessing mbr?
2015-12-06 06:46:09	Stallmanu	yeah the installer does it
2015-12-06 06:46:23	plinnell	AndChat107604: in general, openSUSE or SLES will not mess with MBR
2015-12-06 06:46:49	Stallmanu	the thing is, if you use MBR then it needs you to tell it which drive to use
2015-12-06 06:46:57	plinnell	without grub installed, of course it wont boot
2015-12-06 06:47:10	Stallmanu	YaST will tell you what it picked during the summary page but you can change which drive it uses
2015-12-06 06:47:19	plinnell	exactly
2015-12-06 06:47:39	 *	Stallmanu nostalgia messing with the MBR setting
2015-12-06 06:48:07	 *	plinnell has not done that in > 10 yrs
2015-12-06 06:49:11	Stallmanu	but I think the default is to use /boot and if you did not make /boot then it should have just made /boot in the / partition
2015-12-06 06:49:38	AndChat107604	so, if I understand correctly, I should have both MBR and grub and I have to point MBR to the correct partition(s)?
2015-12-06 06:49:51	Stallmanu	No, it depends if you mess with the defaults
2015-12-06 06:50:00	Stallmanu	By default it will use /boot, not MBR
2015-12-06 06:50:19	Stallmanu	If it uses /boot it depends where you place /boot, by default on Leap it is a subvolume inside the / partition
2015-12-06 06:50:39	Stallmanu	So when you boot you need to do it from the drive that has /
2015-12-06 06:51:21	Stallmanu	But if you want to use MBR then you need to make sure you select the correct drive, otherwise it picks a drive and you can only use that drive to boot
2015-12-06 06:53:29	Stallmanu	plinnell: btw question, were the penguins added to the grub theme recently or have they always been in the live cd?

2015-12-06 14:06:53	LEDfan_	Hi is there a way to completely remove/disable Iptables? For some reason a service is adding  iptables  rules to block traffic. When I flush iptables (http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-iptables-how-to-flush-all-rules.html) the rules are removed. However they re-appear...
2015-12-06 14:07:16	LEDfan_	I'll reboot now to check if they re-appear.
2015-12-06 14:08:24	Miuku	LEDfan_: Have you disable susefirewall?
2015-12-06 14:08:29	Miuku	Disabled that is.

2015-12-06 14:09:54	Miuku	You just need to modprobe them.

2015-12-06 14:10:36	LEDfan_	tuxawy: yes the firewall in YAST is disbaled. When I open yast to edit firewall rules it says there is already an other firewall active, but there isn't only the iptables rules

2015-12-06 14:14:01	Miuku	tuxawy: Well, you need to give the command the module name as a parameter and it'll try to load it. Although I haven't used VMware WS12 on Linux, I would assume it loads them on startup anyway.

2015-12-06 14:16:54	Miuku	tuxawy: There you go, you fixed it on your own. :-)

2015-12-06 14:18:04	LEDfan_	okay it worked, no iptables rule and no message that there is another firewall running. So flushing actually did worked some time ago. Thanks again!
2015-12-06 14:18:39	Miuku	LEDfan_: SuSEfirewall is actually pretty decent with its defaults and you can add custom tcp/udp port / addresses with the Custom tab.
2015-12-06 14:18:40	ananke	so when do those rules re-appear?

2015-12-06 14:20:29	LEDfan_	ananke: so far they didn't. I think in the past I/a service (or a update to 42.1 , and downgrade to 13.2) changed some rules in iptables, with the result that yast says there is an firewall and then I flushed and I tough I disbaled it but I didn't.
2015-12-06 14:20:50	LEDfan_	Just a miss understanding from my point, the issue was solved but i didn't know it...

2015-12-06 21:32:59	irrequietus	Phazeus_tux: no problem, I am not an english speaker either but that shouldn't be an obstacle for us communicating :)
2015-12-06 21:33:01	irrequietus	sure
2015-12-06 21:33:11	timorL	I think a file system might be ready after the project itself says so.  Even today it says "Is btrfs stable? Maybe" and  about external users "Not too many companies have said that they are using Btrfs in production".
2015-12-06 21:33:18	nuno_nunes	Phazeus_tux, goodnight
2015-12-06 21:33:46	nuno_nunes	good‍night , boa noite
2015-12-06 21:33:50	Phazeus_tux	irrequietus,   anycase, for non-expert users I never will recommend Btrfs. Only who familiar with Linux can shoose it.
2015-12-06 21:33:57	irrequietus	timorL: which is what puzzles me, that some do.
2015-12-06 21:34:08	irrequietus	Phazeus_tux: agreed 100%
2015-12-06 21:34:09	Phazeus_tux	and we newer use btrfs on servers with critical data
2015-12-06 21:34:18	Phazeus_tux	and on SSD
2015-12-06 21:34:27	irrequietus	servers with critical data need backups :P
2015-12-06 21:34:44	Phazeus_tux	not on Btrfs snapshots :D
2015-12-06 21:34:47	nuno_nunes	Phazeus_tux, i using ext4 and change music audio app
2015-12-06 21:35:05	irrequietus	Phazeus_tux: snapshots are not real backup, just fast bandaid!
2015-12-06 21:35:20	Phazeus_tux	yes))
2015-12-06 21:35:34	irrequietus	I wouldn't trust somebody saying that his backups were fs snapshots on the same physical media anyway.
2015-12-06 21:36:08	Phazeus_tux	we make them with dd/dd_rescue   and copy data/configs/bases also :)
2015-12-06 21:36:35	Phazeus_tux	know,has more "proper" way ... :)
2015-12-06 21:37:16	Phazeus_tux	but really Ext4 never has fail :) All still works without issues. With btrfs we already has data losting
2015-12-06 21:37:57	Phazeus_tux	may be cause we noobs... But let btrfs to be an "hackers toy"
2015-12-06 21:38:21	irrequietus	well, using it on some boxes for some time (but not on my laptop, yet) I can say surely that it DOES need a lot of care.
2015-12-06 21:38:34	irrequietus	and you can't just hop from kernel to kernel as if nothing happened.
2015-12-06 21:38:42	winston_smith	What do you guys recommend for differential local backups?
2015-12-06 21:38:48	Phazeus_tux	yes and you should know it, how to configure, etc.

2015-12-07 00:05:05	pilne	leap isn't 32bit though
2015-12-07 00:05:06	popnfloss	im installing it on an old eee pc model that is 32bit
2015-12-07 00:05:14	popnfloss	so i guess ill use 13.2
2015-12-07 00:05:19	Stallmanu	yeah leap does not have a 32 bit
2015-12-07 00:05:31	Stallmanu	You can try Tumbleweed if thats more to your liking
2015-12-07 00:05:45	popnfloss	i need a stable release
2015-12-07 00:05:53	Stallmanu	then 13.2 :)
2015-12-07 00:05:56	popnfloss	im going to be using it for pentesting at work
2015-12-07 00:06:08	Stallmanu	what tools?
2015-12-07 00:06:15	popnfloss	and other network stuff

2015-12-07 00:07:17	popnfloss	nmap, metasploit, etc.
2015-12-07 00:07:38	Stallmanu	good luck installing metasploit
2015-12-07 00:08:03	Stallmanu	oh wait nvm
2015-12-07 00:08:10	 *	Stallmanu was thinking of armitage
2015-12-07 00:08:11	pilne	i mean, don't get me wrong, i love SUSE more each day, but i still use kali for my pentesting
2015-12-07 00:08:39	Stallmanu	Assuming metaspoit is the actual metasploit then it should be more simple to setup
2015-12-07 00:08:47	popnfloss	can you install a commandline only system with kali
2015-12-07 00:09:23	popnfloss	iirc its debian based so id rather just install debian and get the packages i need as i need them
2015-12-07 00:09:29	popnfloss	if i go that route
2015-12-07 00:09:48	pilne	fair enough, i just don't like dicking around with tweaking the kernel myself (:
2015-12-07 00:10:07	popnfloss	this laptop only has a 2GB hdd so it needs to be minimal

2015-12-10 22:23:15	winicius	thank you
2015-12-10 22:23:45	winicius	glxinfo gives me the error: "Error: unable to open display"
2015-12-10 22:24:20	winicius	and glxgears Error: couldn't open display (null)

2015-12-10 22:24:56	winicius	ok
2015-12-10 22:25:02	winicius	now the error is Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual or fbconfig
2015-12-10 22:26:15	boombatower	zypper in susepaste
2015-12-10 22:26:59	boombatower	then run this as root sh -c 'lspci | grep VGA ; lsmod | grep "kms\|drm"' | susepaste
2015-12-10 22:27:06	boombatower	then we can see what driver and such it's using
2015-12-10 22:27:17	winicius	ok
2015-12-10 22:27:34	boombatower	just curious, but I'm guessing it's not going to work well on oss driver as reading online it looks like r7 is same gen as r9 3xx which makes sense
2015-12-10 22:27:57	boombatower	i know 4.4 is about the first actually usable amdgpu as it has frequency setting and such
2015-12-10 22:28:00	boombatower	so you may be on the edge

2015-12-10 22:29:51	boombatower	if you are adventurous we can look at trying out amdgpu
2015-12-10 22:29:56	boombatower	possible on 4.4 kernel

2015-12-10 22:40:08	boombatower	all due to the switch over to amdgpu (built somewhat from scatch)

2015-12-12 21:06:43	LukynZ	Hi guys, I've just upgraded form 13.2 to Leap...I'd like to know, if there is any way to find any orphan packages in system. The rpmorphan program should do it, but I'm really not sure, 'cause the output shows package which should be still used...I think. And zypper probably can't handle this. Is there any other way?

2015-12-12 21:09:08	Miuku	rpmorphan isn't completely reliable though.
2015-12-12 21:09:36	LukynZ	I mean mainly dependencies not used anymore...from old, mainly qt4 versions etc.

2015-12-12 21:10:28	tacit	Also the definition of "orphan packages" is usually lacking. People mean "unreqired packages", but technically it's a package required by nothing else - a "leaf" package. But most of them are actually used. There is no way for zypper to know.
2015-12-12 21:11:09	tacit	LukynZ: zypper does not distinguish between implicitly installed packages (as dependencies) and those that you installed explicitly. Hence it cannot know what you think are orphans.

2015-12-13 18:13:38	Stallmanu	would be better if it could be used with "watch" command but that doesnt seem to let you scroll with the output (since it goes off screen)

2015-12-13 18:49:05	Firefishe	I'm working out an update scenario from 13.2 to 42.x (Leap).  I've done 'zypper refresh' and 'zypper update'.  zypper is indicating that some packages are not going to be installed.  Should i do a 'zypper dist-upgrade' to install these packages before doing the complete upgrade to Leap?

2015-12-13 18:53:23	tacit	Firefishe: The message is related to an unrelated mechanic. Zypper up in no the right tool for what you are doing, and it's not an update but an upgrade. dup is the way to go.

2015-12-13 18:54:33	Firefishe	Well, that general upgrade page.
2015-12-13 18:55:05	Firefishe	There is a section on using dup...I'm reading it now.
2015-12-13 18:55:27	Stallmanu	Firefishe: oh, why did you use up? I dont see it on the page
2015-12-13 18:55:41	Stallmanu	Firefishe: and as tacit said dup is the tool to use for this
2015-12-13 18:56:11	tacit	Stallmanu: 'sup
2015-12-13 18:56:12	Firefishe	Yes, but there are repository issues that have to be done first, before dup.

2015-12-13 21:09:49	High	Here is update to my problem, notice I'm not in Suse, but this applies there just as well. Simply b/c it's Xorg and not Suse specific.
2015-12-13 21:10:08	High	I was in Suse when the problem occured, persisted across all distros I've used.

2015-12-14 01:42:58	somebody	Hi. Can anyone point me to a video of how to use the Activities thing in the KDE?
2015-12-14 01:43:29	somebody	I might be missing somehting, can't really wrap my head around how it can be useful.
2015-12-14 01:43:49	Stallmanu	multiple desktops are much better
2015-12-14 01:43:56	Stallmanu	as in virtual desktops
2015-12-14 01:44:02	 *	plinnell agrees
2015-12-14 01:44:22	somebody	Let me make sure I even get the idea behind it.
2015-12-14 01:44:27	Stallmanu	activities is one of those silly features that still gets support for some reason that I will never understand
2015-12-14 01:44:39	somebody	It's another metaphor for representing the application's windows, right?
2015-12-14 01:45:09	somebody	Only it does not only give you desktop-like spread, but also allows you to individually configure wallpapers and Plasma elemets.
2015-12-14 01:45:17	Stallmanu	No they are like "virtualized" desktop invironments, you can have different settings for different activities
2015-12-14 01:46:03	Stallmanu	like one activity can have icons desktop mode and the other can have nothing configured
2015-12-14 01:47:26	somebody	Stallmanu: Yeah, that's what I was saying.
2015-12-14 01:47:59	somebody	So it's a metaphor for representing windows, on a higer level than desktops.
2015-12-14 01:48:19	somebody	I guess I can imagine some way how _that_ can be useful... But not too much.
