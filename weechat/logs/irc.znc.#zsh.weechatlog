2016-01-16 15:16:48	a_p3rson|D1	[09:04:21] Hey y'all, having problems with zsh+tmux over SSH on a Debian server. I'm able to use partial history completion on the command line, but I'm unable to use the up/down arrow keys in man/top/everything else (have to push shift). My up/down keys are both bound in ~/.zshrc to history-substring-search-up/down - any way to fix this?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	a_p3rson|D1	[09:06:03] Just tried turning those bindings off, and I'm still unable to get arrow keys to work properly, actually.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	hyper_void	[09:16:17] is there a way for autocomplete to chose the file I use the most in a dir?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	izabera	[09:17:49] no
2016-01-16 15:16:48	heoyea	[09:18:44] whats that autocomplete called? if i type /ho/u/Do and it autocompletes /home/user/Downloads
2016-01-16 15:16:48	xaxes	[09:39:30] hey all.. I remembering to had a zsh history which was related to a given command. Let's say I enter "cp " and want to go through last cp commands I was able to simply use the up-key. Now it scrolls up the complete history. Can anybody tell me how the option is named?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	heoyea	[10:04:52] xaxes: this? http://ix.io/nsP
2016-01-16 15:16:48	xaxes	[10:08:04] heoyea: perfect! Thats exactly what I searched for. Thank you very much! :)

2016-01-16 15:16:48	OxFEEDBACC	[14:39:30] i was just trying to figure out why my(?) rsync swallows *.*.sample files... #rsync isn't that responsive and a quick grep over my $(rpm -qlf =rsync) files didn't reveal a system issue)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	psprint	[14:47:00] to remove empty elements from array, one should do array=( $array[@] ) ?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	osse	[14:48:52] psprint: that works, but then if $array[2] is removed then $array[3] will become $array[2] etc
2016-01-16 15:16:48	psprint	[14:50:39] that's fine
2016-01-16 15:16:48	osse	[14:51:49] it usually is
2016-01-16 15:16:48	osse	[14:52:07] maybe there's a more proper way to do it with fancy parameter expansion
2016-01-16 15:16:48	osse	[14:52:27] hmm, i think you want array=( "$array[@]" ). can't remember
2016-01-16 15:16:48	psprint	[14:54:23] this will preserve empty elements
2016-01-16 15:16:48	osse	[14:55:19] oh right

2016-01-16 15:19:04	psprint	compadd, to decide whether to insert a text into cmd line, checks if cursor is at end of a word – and then adds only right part of the word. However, it doesn't understand shell words, and when $((<Tab> is done, it decides to insert whole word. Any thoughts on this?
