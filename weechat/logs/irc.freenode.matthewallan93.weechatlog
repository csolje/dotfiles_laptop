2015-11-30 11:15:40	psyq	nice
2015-11-30 11:16:02	psyq	so you use that instead of i3bar?
2015-11-30 11:16:47	MatthewAllan93	no i use conky as my status bar with font awesome and dunst as a notification e.g. when someone says your name on irc etc
2015-11-30 11:19:50	psyq	I sweet how do I get that to work?

2015-11-30 11:31:51	MatthewAllan93	no they are from font awesome on github https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/

2015-11-30 21:15:12	psyq	it is now
2015-11-30 21:15:29	MatthewAllan93	ok, conky working or not?
2015-11-30 21:16:35	psyq	same thing
2015-11-30 21:18:57	MatthewAllan93	ah ok
2015-11-30 21:21:41	MatthewAllan93	changing a few things around on my i3 config but nothing to do with conky, just yet but as i said i will be defintely researching it to see 
2015-11-30 21:22:50	psyq	Matt you have a command in your config that is "exec --no-startup-id urxvtd -q -o -f &" <-- what is that for?
2015-11-30 21:23:03	MatthewAllan93	to start the urxvt daemon
2015-11-30 21:23:44	MatthewAllan93	i think you could take the & off though
2015-11-30 21:24:39	psyq	okie but why are you starting the daemon up?
2015-11-30 21:25:23	MatthewAllan93	its says on the arch wiki, rxvt-unicode can be daemonized to run clients within a single process in order to minimize the use of system resources
2015-11-30 21:25:42	psyq	really
2015-11-30 21:25:51	MatthewAllan93	yes
2015-11-30 21:26:00	psyq	damn I will add that one in then
2015-11-30 21:26:50	psyq	what are you using compton for?
2015-11-30 21:27:06	MatthewAllan93	haha :), transparency for urxvt
2015-11-30 21:28:06	psyq	hahahaha 
2015-11-30 21:28:10	psyq	nice
2015-11-30 21:28:37	psyq	I am downloading some wallpapers now just so I have something to look at XD
2015-11-30 21:29:08	MatthewAllan93	i learned a lot of this from ldc's youtube channel :), thats Irishluck83 does videos for. That was before i joined the forums and irc channel :)
2015-11-30 21:29:13	MatthewAllan93	oh good :)
2015-11-30 21:31:02	psyq	Matt can you please walk me though your setup because it seems like that is a lot of very nice thing 
2015-11-30 21:31:29	psyq	and I want to learn more about how to customize my desktop :)
2015-11-30 21:31:37	MatthewAllan93	haha :), what would you like know?
2015-11-30 21:32:32	psyq	well the last part of your config file from "setxkbmap gb &" and down really
2015-11-30 21:33:02	MatthewAllan93	i would take the & off it because i can't remember my reason for putting that on
2015-11-30 21:33:16	MatthewAllan93	but that loads the keyboard layout for great britain
2015-11-30 21:34:07	psyq	and then it runs urxvt as a daemon
2015-11-30 21:34:23	MatthewAllan93	yes 
2015-11-30 21:35:12	psyq	unclutter what is that for?
2015-11-30 21:35:22	MatthewAllan93	then compton -b runs compton as a daemon
2015-11-30 21:35:36	MatthewAllan93	unclutter is to hide the mouse for sometime of inactivity
2015-11-30 21:36:17	psyq	sweet 
2015-11-30 21:36:47	MatthewAllan93	yes it is :)
2015-11-30 21:37:03	MatthewAllan93	numlockx will turn your numlock on when the window manager starts
2015-11-30 21:37:26	MatthewAllan93	nm-applet -t is if you have network-manager-applet installed, it will start it in the tray
2015-11-30 21:37:42	MatthewAllan93	then the last one of that section is to open urxvt with tmux on workspace 1
2015-11-30 21:38:11	psyq	and why is it you do that by the way?
2015-11-30 21:38:22	MatthewAllan93	which?
2015-11-30 21:39:28	psyq	the last part
2015-11-30 21:40:19	MatthewAllan93	it is because when i first boot up my computer i usually like to login into irc via weechat, so i need a terminal and if i use tmux, i can use multi terminals because it is multiplexer
2015-11-30 21:40:54	psyq	sweet
2015-11-30 21:41:14	psyq	but why don't you just open a new terminal?
2015-11-30 21:41:34	MatthewAllan93	most of the time, i like to be on one screen
2015-11-30 21:43:00	psyq	okie that makes perfect since
2015-11-30 21:43:15	psyq	Matt are you using any filemanager?
2015-11-30 21:43:22	MatthewAllan93	i have changed my i3 folder to ~/.config/i3 because of the documentation of the order it loads in
2015-11-30 21:43:29	MatthewAllan93	yes i use ranger and spacefm
2015-11-30 21:44:03	psyq	you have any screenshots of them in action?
2015-11-30 21:44:35	MatthewAllan93	not really sorry
2015-11-30 21:45:14	psyq	okie
2015-11-30 21:45:42	MatthewAllan93	both are really minimal :)
2015-11-30 21:46:15	psyq	spacefm is that a GUI?
2015-11-30 21:46:23	MatthewAllan93	yes it is
2015-11-30 21:46:31	psyq	okie
2015-11-30 21:47:12	psyq	oohh the tmux how do I navigate in that?
2015-11-30 21:49:11	MatthewAllan93	i think to control and b will unbind the keys and then either " for horizontal and & for verticial, i think
2015-11-30 21:49:32	MatthewAllan93	i might gnu screen soon to see what it is like
2015-11-30 21:50:05	psyq	I heard that tmux is the best one
2015-11-30 21:50:31	MatthewAllan93	yes i heard that also but want to see what it is like
2015-11-30 21:50:33	MatthewAllan93	haha
2015-11-30 21:50:52	psyq	but I don't know because I have never used any of them
2015-11-30 21:51:03	MatthewAllan93	oh ok
2015-11-30 21:57:40	psyq	Matt if I have named my workspaces and I want to run something in workspace 2 which is called workspace 2:IM how would I do that?
2015-11-30 21:58:10	MatthewAllan93	exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace 2:IM; exec PROGRAM"
2015-11-30 21:58:19	psyq	sweet
2015-11-30 21:58:34	MatthewAllan93	i mean a single quotation mark sorry
2015-11-30 21:58:41	MatthewAllan93	at the end
2015-11-30 21:58:53	psyq	hehe okie
2015-11-30 21:59:11	psyq	and the clipit what is it you are using that for?
2015-11-30 21:59:55	MatthewAllan93	just a clipboard manager
2015-11-30 22:00:09	psyq	oohh nice
2015-11-30 22:00:32	psyq	so now I can copy and paste to and from terminal
2015-11-30 22:39:12	psyq	matt
2015-11-30 22:46:23	MatthewAllan93	oh good :)
2015-11-30 22:47:23	MatthewAllan93	yes
2015-11-30 22:49:35	psyq	I got everything to work now
2015-11-30 22:49:48	MatthewAllan93	oh good
2015-11-30 22:49:57	MatthewAllan93	what was the problem?
2015-11-30 22:50:02	psyq	even the other thing with the urxvt -e tmux
2015-11-30 22:50:20	MatthewAllan93	did you get conky to work?
2015-11-30 22:50:49	◀▬▬	MatthewAllan93 (~weechat@unaffiliated/matthewallan93) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.3)
2015-11-30 22:50:54	psyq	nnaaa not yet still looking at what they did after the update 
2015-11-30 22:50:54	--	MatthewAllan93: No such nick/channel
2015-11-30 22:51:12	▬▬▶	MatthewAllan93 (~weechat@unaffiliated/matthewallan93) is back on server
2015-11-30 22:51:44	MatthewAllan93	sorry about exited my terminal by mistake haha

2015-11-30 22:52:22	psyq	nnaaa not yet still looking at what they did after the update 
2015-11-30 22:52:29	MatthewAllan93	ah ok
2015-11-30 22:53:07	psyq	but I think it is the way we implement the conky in the statusbar
2015-11-30 22:53:20	MatthewAllan93	oh
2015-11-30 22:53:37	MatthewAllan93	thats the way i have done it for about a year now
2015-11-30 22:53:49	psyq	I mean that might be it
2015-11-30 22:53:57	MatthewAllan93	oh ok
2015-11-30 22:54:13	psyq	the developers in i3 might have changed somethings
2015-11-30 22:54:24	MatthewAllan93	i think that also
2015-11-30 22:55:38	psyq	but I can find any documention on my theory
2015-11-30 22:55:40	psyq	:/
2015-11-30 22:59:51	MatthewAllan93	ah ok
2015-11-30 23:17:19	psyq	hhmm
2015-12-06 12:19:15	MatthewAllan93	sorry i don't get your question
2015-12-06 12:20:55	psyq	well Arch is really easy to get to look the way you want for example setting up openbox was like the easiest thing I have ever tried and getting themes for openbox was easy too
2015-12-06 12:21:22	psyq	I love both Arch and Void but I am more into Void I most say
2015-12-06 12:22:40	psyq	Actually my problem is sticking to one distro hehehehe
2015-12-06 12:23:40	MatthewAllan93	haha oh, i am the same. i switch distro like once a month haha
2015-12-06 12:23:45	MatthewAllan93	*distros
2015-12-06 12:42:33	psyq	okie really
2015-12-06 12:43:57	psyq	that sounds like me hehehe
2015-12-06 12:44:17	psyq	well I am going between gentoo, Arch and Void now hahahhaa
2015-12-06 12:47:11	psyq	and now I am having the problem I can't remember how I got my urxvt to look the way I did on my openSUSE box
2015-12-06 12:48:54	psyq	be right back
2015-12-06 14:00:36	MatthewAllan93	ah ok
2015-12-06 14:24:44	psyq	talk to you later matt
2015-12-06 16:46:17	MatthewAllan93	zsh with the oh-my-zsh and the theme is called minimal :)

2015-12-06 16:55:17	MatthewAllan93	haha
2015-12-06 16:56:08	psyq	that is nice because I can't get my powerline theme to work on my voidlinux box and arch
2015-12-06 16:56:09	psyq	:(
2015-12-06 16:56:20	MatthewAllan93	oh :(

2015-12-09 21:32:55	MatthewAllan93	i mean starred my configuration repository, sorry
2015-12-09 21:33:08	MatthewAllan93	yes but i also took it out of my i3 config file
2015-12-09 21:33:39	psyq	oohh okie
2015-12-09 21:33:57	MatthewAllan93	just thought i would let you know :)

2015-12-09 21:34:38	psyq	MatthewAllan93: I just starred this url https://notabug.org/matthewallan93/
2015-12-09 21:35:03	MatthewAllan93	ah ok :)
2015-12-09 21:35:57	psyq	so it is not a problem
2015-12-09 21:36:23	psyq	but you will remake the configurations repo or a new one?
2015-12-09 21:41:02	--	irc: disconnected from server
2015-12-09 22:01:20	MatthewAllan93	i have made a new one but took out my conky, tmux and vim files and put my modified i3 config file in it 
2015-12-09 22:01:58	psyq	why you took out ur vim and tmux
2015-12-09 22:02:37	MatthewAllan93	wanted to try out emacs and not really tmux that much recently. so i uninstalled it 
2015-12-09 22:02:48	MatthewAllan93	*really using
2015-12-09 22:05:10	psyq	emacs
2015-12-09 22:05:22	psyq	isn't that an editor?
2015-12-09 22:05:37	MatthewAllan93	yes it is a editor by gnu
2015-12-09 22:06:07	psyq	what did you use tmux for?
2015-12-09 22:06:32	MatthewAllan93	just to create other terminals in one terminal session
2015-12-09 22:07:24	psyq	okie
2015-12-09 22:07:45	psyq	so you are going to try out emacs for
2015-12-09 22:23:38	psyq	MatthewAllan93: didn't you use vim?
2015-12-09 23:02:17	MatthewAllan93	yes i did but not a lot 
2015-12-09 23:02:34	MatthewAllan93	i used it for the usual editing files :)
2015-12-09 23:13:47	psyq	okie so now you want to see if emacs is better
2015-12-09 23:13:55	psyq	or you like it better I mean
2015-12-09 23:14:17	MatthewAllan93	yes :)
2015-12-09 23:14:41	psyq	that is always a good thing
2015-12-09 23:59:52	--	irc: disconnected from server
2015-12-13 23:38:00	MatthewAllan93	yes i am still using i3 but just wanted to configure awesome also :)
2015-12-13 23:38:44	MatthewAllan93	i don't think you can download themes for it but you can change the colours of the status bar, window border, focused window border and a bit more
2015-12-13 23:47:40	psyq	well that is not enough hehehe I like i3 because it is lightweight and simple but I want more you know
2015-12-13 23:48:33	MatthewAllan93	i get what you mean
2015-12-13 23:48:44	psyq	I was talking to Irish and he told me to go with Awesome or Xmonad
2015-12-13 23:48:55	MatthewAllan93	ah yes you could :)
2015-12-13 23:49:37	psyq	but I am not sure that I want to go Xmonad because it is in Haskell and Awesome is in lua
2015-12-13 23:50:03	MatthewAllan93	yes that is the only problem, if you are not comfortable with programming
2015-12-13 23:50:43	psyq	so I am thinking about trying out awesome and maybe later on try Xmonad
2015-12-13 23:51:20	MatthewAllan93	yes you could do :)
2015-12-13 23:51:34	MatthewAllan93	i was going to try xmonad sometime soon :)
2015-12-13 23:51:43	MatthewAllan93	and also bspwm
2015-12-13 23:51:56	psyq	programming is not the problem it is the time it takes to get into the the syntax and messing around with it and I remember a little bit of the lua so we will see
2015-12-13 23:52:28	psyq	bspwm I was thinking about it but I am not so sure if I want it because of the binds
2015-12-13 23:52:36	psyq	keybinds that is hahah
2015-12-13 23:52:51	MatthewAllan93	ah ok i get what you mean haha
2015-12-13 23:54:22	psyq	MatthewAllan93 are you going to do bspwm soon or?
2015-12-14 00:03:07	MatthewAllan93	probably try it in a week or so
2015-12-14 00:03:18	psyq	nice
2015-12-14 01:48:24	--	irc: disconnected from server

2015-12-18 00:01:32	MatthewAllan93	sorry for the late reply only just seen your message from last night. i am the same about awesome, i3wm and xmonad :)
2015-12-18 00:14:36	psyq	well I am starting to not like xmonad that much
2015-12-18 00:14:48	psyq	but I will figure it out
2015-12-18 00:14:52	psyq	I hope
2015-12-18 00:55:51	--	irc: disconnected from server
2015-12-20 20:56:46	MatthewAllan93	yes i did :)
2015-12-20 20:57:00	MatthewAllan93	the "xorg-minimal" meta-package
2015-12-20 20:57:09	psyq	the command was xbps-install -S xorg-minimal
2015-12-20 20:57:11	psyq	okie
2015-12-20 20:57:37	psyq	I just forgot about it and now I am installing void on my workstation at work
2015-12-20 20:58:45	MatthewAllan93	oh good :), yes thats it
2015-12-20 20:59:34	psyq	thank you :)
2015-12-20 21:00:39	MatthewAllan93	no problem :)
2015-12-20 21:01:24	MatthewAllan93	it install the bare essentials but if you need synaptics for example for a laptop. it won't install that
2015-12-20 21:01:29	MatthewAllan93	*installs
2015-12-20 21:02:27	psyq	it is okie
2015-12-20 21:05:07	MatthewAllan93	Ok just thought I would let you know about it :).
2015-12-20 21:05:28	psyq	thank you MatthewAllan93 :)
2015-12-20 21:05:59	MatthewAllan93	No problem :), always happy to help :).
2015-12-21 00:48:34	psyq	Matt u her?
2015-12-21 00:48:41	psyq	are you here I mean
2015-12-21 21:32:12	MatthewAllan93	i used a weechat chat called iset
2015-12-21 21:33:07	psyq	okie do you have the config file or do you know how to reset it?
2015-12-21 21:35:10	MatthewAllan93	i think mine has personal information e.g. password or something like that. but you could delete the .weechat folder and then open weechat again and it should be default
2015-12-21 21:35:37	psyq	okie 
2015-12-21 21:36:11	psyq	then it is back to figuring out how to customizing it hehehehe :P
2015-12-21 21:36:16	psyq	darn
2015-12-21 21:36:18	psyq	hahahah
2015-12-21 21:36:38	MatthewAllan93	haha oh ok
2015-12-21 21:37:27	psyq	yeah I forgot how I customized it, but anyways I didn't like the first one I made so I think it is all the same hahaha
2015-12-21 21:38:37	MatthewAllan93	haha oh i get what you mean
2015-12-21 21:39:09	psyq	and the funny thing is the #weechat channel is a bit dead
2015-12-21 21:39:29	psyq	I asked a question there last night and no one answered hahaha
2015-12-21 21:39:58	psyq	well it was 2 am here in Denmark that might explain it
2015-12-21 21:45:38	MatthewAllan93	haha it might :P, but i would of thought someone would be on at that time

2015-12-21 21:52:00	MatthewAllan93	i know :(
2015-12-21 21:53:20	MatthewAllan93	did you find the script i was talking about?
2015-12-21 21:53:37	psyq	yeah the iset

2015-12-21 21:55:31	psyq	okie is it making that sidebar with all the buffers in it?
2015-12-21 21:58:44	MatthewAllan93	the buffers appear by using the buffers.pl script for weechat :)
2015-12-21 21:59:09	MatthewAllan93	but iset just makes it so much easier to customise everything in weechat
2015-12-21 21:59:10	psyq	okie then what is iset.pl for
2015-12-21 21:59:19	psyq	okie

2015-12-27 20:33:08	psyq	but i am having some problems with the void and Xmonad
2015-12-27 20:36:30	MatthewAllan93	ah ok :), why?
2015-12-27 20:42:33	psyq	it doesn't work with the keybinds that i want
2015-12-27 20:43:56	MatthewAllan93	ah that is strange, i haven't used xmonad before
2015-12-27 21:01:19	psyq	yes but it is fine

2015-12-29 21:31:08	psyq	but I have noticed something about Void and that is that the ethernet card isn't named enp0sxx it is eno1 on my workstation at work
2015-12-29 21:31:21	psyq	why is it changing the name to eno1
2015-12-29 21:33:47	MatthewAllan93	i wouldn't know sorry

2016-01-04 20:22:13	psyq	well maybe I should do that 
2016-01-04 20:24:31	MatthewAllan93	Yes maybe haha

2016-01-04 20:33:19	psyq	yeah
2016-01-04 20:33:40	psyq	matt did you see the answer in #voidlinux
2016-01-04 20:35:00	MatthewAllan93	Yes I did :), thanks :).
2016-01-04 20:35:12	psyq	welcome

2016-01-05 22:18:51	MatthewAllan93	Not sure sorry.
2016-01-05 22:23:15	psyq	I will find out cuz now I know why it is not working
2016-01-05 22:23:42	psyq	void doesn't compile urxvt with unicode3 and frills
2016-01-05 22:23:57	psyq	that is the reason it is not working
2016-01-05 22:24:31	MatthewAllan93	Ah ok, makes sense.
2016-01-05 22:25:13	psyq	yeah but the problem is now how do we enable them
2016-01-05 22:27:29	MatthewAllan93	Probably as a configure arguement while compiling or in the template for the package.
2016-01-05 22:27:47	psyq	hmm okie
2016-01-10 21:43:01	MatthewAllan93	i3wm for now but still configuring awesome at the moment because I can't get dmenu to work properly with it yourself?
2016-01-10 21:43:29	psyq	I am using Xmonad now
2016-01-10 21:43:41	MatthewAllan93	Oh good :)

2016-01-14 20:57:19	MatthewAllan93	No sorry but I will do some research
2016-01-14 20:59:45	MatthewAllan93	Have you had a look at the man page for feh?
2016-01-14 20:59:57	psyq	I will look into it now

2016-01-14 21:03:55	MatthewAllan93	Oh good :)
2016-01-14 21:04:57	psyq	you can use it as a slideshow and it will change the background with a time interval
2016-01-14 21:05:13	MatthewAllan93	:)
2016-01-15 22:00:44	MatthewAllan93	For what?
2016-01-15 22:01:03	psyq	your HVM
2016-01-15 22:01:13	MatthewAllan93	Debian 8
2016-01-15 22:01:18	psyq	or it is that you picked
2016-01-15 22:01:50	MatthewAllan93	In the list on Gandi, it was Debian 8 (HVM).
2016-01-15 22:02:50	psyq	what about specs?
2016-01-15 22:10:01	MatthewAllan93	1 core, 256mb, 3gb disk
2016-01-15 22:10:23	psyq	really you don't need more then that?
2016-01-15 22:10:34	psyq	how about transfer?
2016-01-15 22:10:58	MatthewAllan93	Not for my website and it is my first vps but I do quite a bit with it also.
2016-01-15 22:11:06	MatthewAllan93	what do you mean transfer?
2016-01-15 22:11:36	psyq	the network they have like 1 TB traffic etc
2016-01-15 22:13:00	psyq	I just read it is 2 TB
2016-01-15 22:13:16	MatthewAllan93	Ah ok, mine is 100.00 Mb of dedicated bandwidth but it can all be modified.
2016-01-15 22:13:51	psyq	okie not when it is the first VPS you are going to buy now hehehe
2016-01-15 22:14:17	psyq	you are running your irc bouncer too from that one?
2016-01-15 22:14:39	MatthewAllan93	Mine really is proper basic haha. Yes I am using ZNC :).
2016-01-15 22:15:26	psyq	it is actually cheaper then digitalocean with that setup
2016-01-15 22:15:32	MatthewAllan93	I think that's what it says in the control panel about transfer but not totally sure about that.
2016-01-15 22:15:40	MatthewAllan93	Oh is it.
2016-01-15 22:15:45	psyq	yeah
2016-01-15 22:15:55	MatthewAllan93	Oh :).
2016-01-15 22:16:20	MatthewAllan93	I like that Gandi use open source email system aswell :D.
2016-01-15 22:16:48	psyq	the cheapest one is 5 $ a mouth for 1cpu/523mb/20gb sdd/1TB network
2016-01-15 22:17:43	MatthewAllan93	Ah
2016-01-15 22:18:25	psyq	and I think I will need the 2 TB
2016-01-15 22:18:50	MatthewAllan93	I get what you mean about the bandwidth now.
2016-01-15 22:18:57	psyq	yeah
2016-01-15 22:20:07	MatthewAllan93	I also don't want to create random accounts haha.
2016-01-15 22:23:34	psyq	yeah me too
2016-01-15 22:24:11	psyq	and I got an account at digitalocean and they don't provide domain names
2016-01-15 22:24:55	MatthewAllan93	I know :(, I like that Gandi are a registar and also that they provide domain to open source organisations and projects :).
2016-01-15 22:31:00	MatthewAllan93	*domains

2016-01-16 14:38:51	MatthewAllan93	or the ip address of the vps and then port number after it
2016-01-16 14:40:21	psyq	what port is that?
2016-01-16 14:40:23	psyq	hehehe
2016-01-16 14:40:35	psyq	I think I forgot it XD
2016-01-16 14:41:18	MatthewAllan93	the port that you configure it to use when using the command "znc --make-conf"
2016-01-16 14:41:23	MatthewAllan93	haha XD
2016-01-16 14:41:36	psyq	shot how do I find it now
2016-01-16 14:43:39	MatthewAllan93	cd into .znc/configs, there should be a znc.conf file and it should have the listener port in it :).
2016-01-16 14:44:58	psyq	i forgot to put https
2016-01-16 14:45:11	MatthewAllan93	haha
