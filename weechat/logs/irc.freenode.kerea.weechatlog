2015-12-07 00:19:26	Kerea	lol true
2015-12-07 00:20:28	psyq	okie actually I have no idea what grafics card I have on my workstation 
2015-12-07 00:21:22	Kerea	you can probably find out with an lspci command
2015-12-07 00:21:59	psyq	but I will find out tomorrow because I am using a windows 8.1 at work but I want to install linux on it then make a VM to run the windows box on that
2015-12-07 00:22:13	Kerea	run a dxdiag from Windows
2015-12-07 00:22:20	Kerea	check the Display tab
2015-12-07 00:22:35	Kerea	should tell you the kind of video card it detects
2015-12-07 00:22:46	psyq	i will but i am not at work until tomorrow
2015-12-07 00:23:16	psyq	but i am not sure if I should install Gentoo or Arch on my workstation
2015-12-07 00:23:47	Kerea	Gentoo is more challenging to work with
2015-12-07 00:23:52	Kerea	of the 2, Arch is easier
2015-12-07 00:24:08	psyq	yeah but
2015-12-07 00:24:24	psyq	you know what I think I know what I am going to do
2015-12-07 00:25:00	Kerea	what?
2015-12-07 00:25:10	psyq	arch to start with reinstall my laptop with Gentoo getting to know gentoo and then I can install it on the workstation after that
2015-12-07 00:25:23	Kerea	if you have a break coming up for the holiday
2015-12-07 00:25:29	Kerea	i'd recommend saving Gentoo for that
2015-12-07 00:25:57	Kerea	even with the beefy desktop I have, a complete Gentoo setup with a GUI and basic programs will take me half a day to setup
2015-12-07 00:26:05	Kerea	that's assuming I don't mess up anything along the way
2015-12-07 00:26:13	psyq	I know
2015-12-07 00:26:28	Kerea	once Gentoo is setup though it's easier and less time consuming to work with
2015-12-07 00:26:39	Kerea	the bulk of your troubleshooting after that will come during updates
2015-12-07 00:35:11	psyq	okie
2015-12-07 00:35:59	psyq	but Kerea what did you do in the configs?
2015-12-07 00:36:07	Kerea	configs for what?
2015-12-07 00:36:15	Kerea	you work with a lot of configs in general in Linux hehe
2015-12-07 00:36:17	psyq	awesome
2015-12-07 00:36:30	psyq	with awesomes configs
2015-12-07 00:36:38	Kerea	the easiest way to learn awesome is to play with the configs of other's
2015-12-07 00:36:52	Kerea	and either try to reproduce them or take parts that you like and make them work in your own config
2015-12-07 00:37:05	psyq	i am planning on using msjche's configs
2015-12-07 00:37:07	Kerea	my config comes heavily from msjche
2015-12-07 00:37:26	psyq	I can see it hehehe
2015-12-07 00:37:54	Kerea	right now i just wanted a config i can work with and settle into
2015-12-07 00:37:59	Kerea	i'll be doing more overall later to it
2015-12-07 00:38:25	psyq	how much lua do you know?
2015-12-07 00:39:02	Kerea	you don't really have to know lua to figure out what the config is doing
2015-12-07 00:39:11	Kerea	just a basic understanding of object oriented programming
2015-12-07 00:40:25	psyq	okie
2015-12-07 00:53:53	psyq	well I got my project for me hehehe
2015-12-07 00:55:11	psyq	I will install Arch with plasma or gnome as a failsafe and then install awesome/openbox don't really know which one yet but I will figure it out
2015-12-07 00:59:15	Kerea	i may still do a plasma5 install on this machine
2015-12-07 00:59:22	Kerea	but i love working out of Awesome for most of what i do
2015-12-07 01:00:27	psyq	yeah
2015-12-07 01:00:54	psyq	Kerea how do you navigate with multiple monitors in awesome
2015-12-07 01:01:22	Kerea	modkey + O
2015-12-07 01:01:29	Kerea	modkey + o
2015-12-07 01:01:32	Kerea	lowercase o rather lol
2015-12-07 01:01:43	Kerea	it'll move your current focus window to a different screen
2015-12-07 01:01:52	Kerea	so it's a good way to switch to something on another monitor quickly
2015-12-07 01:02:24	psyq	okie
2015-12-07 01:02:51	psyq	so that is how you go from one screen to another
2015-12-07 01:03:35	Kerea	pretty much
2015-12-15 20:53:14	Kerea	what's up
2015-12-15 20:53:23	Kerea	haven't been paying attention to my laptop lol
2015-12-15 20:57:55	psyq	hehehe
2015-12-15 20:58:44	psyq	well I just wanted to know if you knew anything about using more then one monitor when you don't have nvidia
2015-12-15 21:00:23	Kerea	if you don't have nvidia there's 2 programs that can help with this if you're in a minimal or WM environment
2015-12-15 21:00:27	Kerea	lxrandr and arandr
2015-12-15 21:00:38	Kerea	lxrandr for turning screens on and setting resolution / refresh rates
2015-12-15 21:00:42	Kerea	arandr for monitor placement
2015-12-15 21:02:01	psyq	nice okie thank you Kerea 
2015-12-15 21:02:06	Kerea	anytime
2015-12-15 21:02:21	--	irc: disconnected from server
2015-12-15 23:58:47	Kerea	technically it's not switching
2015-12-15 23:58:54	Kerea	it's just taking your current window focus
2015-12-15 23:58:59	Kerea	and moving it to a different screen
2015-12-15 23:59:12	psyq	okie
2015-12-15 23:59:13	Kerea	that's your Modkey + o
2015-12-15 23:59:26	Kerea	default in AwesomeWM rc.lua config
2015-12-15 23:59:39	psyq	okie
2015-12-15 23:59:52	psyq	coz I am getting a error
2015-12-16 00:00:17	psyq	on line 443 and 444
2015-12-16 00:00:20	Kerea	if you're using one of msjche's configs that's probably why
2015-12-16 00:00:30	psyq	okie
2015-12-16 00:00:40	Kerea	brb i'm leaving work to head home
2015-12-16 00:00:48	Kerea	i'll be back online in about 10-15 minutes traffic depending lol
