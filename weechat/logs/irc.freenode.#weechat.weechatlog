2015-11-08 15:58:52	Prezident	Gentoo packages and base system are built directly from source code according to user defined USE flags. Arch provides a ports-like system to build packages from source, though the Arch base system is designed to be installed as finished i686 / x86_64 binary. This generally makes Arch quicker to build and update, and allows Gentoo to be more customizable systems.
2015-11-08 15:59:04	Trashlord	Arch Build System

2015-11-27 23:05:22	gb	what version?
2015-11-27 23:06:49	Aelius_	I had the variable "${sec.data.Freenode}" set (capital F) but set "${sec.data.freenode}" for irc.server.freenode's sasl password, and it just didnt try sasl (with irc.default_server set to disconnect on fail and freenode's disconnect on fail setting is blank)
2015-11-27 23:06:54	Aelius_	weechat 1.3
2015-11-27 23:07:37	Aelius_	does the irc.default_server establish default settings for all things unspecified?

2015-11-27 23:15:27	gb	yes but you can disable that behaviour if you wish
2015-11-27 23:17:32	@nils_2	Aelius_: you should read docs. a window != buffer in weechat. /set weechat.look.jump_current_to_previous_buffer
2015-11-27 23:17:58	Aelius_	yeah irssi makes similar distinctions
2015-11-27 23:19:18	gb	it helps getting your terms right if looking in iset, you'd never find that setting with /iset window
2015-11-27 23:24:31	Aelius_	two questions related to /names; is there away to format it nicer (into columns rather than just spewing out all over the terminal), and is there a way to clear that output from the scrollback without clearing chat?
2015-11-27 23:24:35	gb	same deal with /plugin load versus /perl load etc
2015-11-27 23:25:19	gb	you can disable backlog
2015-11-27 23:25:49	@nils_2	no, no

2015-11-27 23:26:00	Aelius_	and hmm that's a pity
2015-11-27 23:27:06	@nils_2	filter /names. so you can toggle filter on/off
2015-11-27 23:27:25	gb	you can still /grep through the log if your backlog is 0
2015-11-27 23:28:07	Aelius_	filters could work, reading up on them
2015-11-27 23:28:55	 *	gb recommends smart filter example in /help filter
2015-11-27 23:29:23	Aelius_	gb re:grep , nah- the idea is that the client is showing non-chat related information injected into the chat. Should be able to clear it from the chat to reduce clutter
2015-11-27 23:30:45	gb	also set the offline color so if you have scrolled up and miss the quit you do not reply to a nick long gone

2015-11-29 11:57:34	voidead	second,third,fourth etc
2015-11-29 11:58:07	choki	i want something more from my home row >:(
2015-11-29 11:58:08	gb	i actually have nick alignment set to none which prints nick once and lets chat text flow under the nick
2015-11-29 11:58:30	sim642	voidead, use nick_suffix
2015-11-29 11:58:32	gb	might be prefix_align i do not recall
2015-11-29 11:58:36	choki	yes prefix align
2015-11-29 11:58:37	sim642	and make prefix_suffix empty
2015-11-29 11:58:47	choki	wait, there is a suffix?
2015-11-29 11:58:51	sim642	nick_suffix is only put into lines which have a nick
2015-11-29 11:58:55	sim642	prefix_suffix goes into all
2015-11-29 11:59:04	sim642	even if you hide some prefixes with that same setting
2015-11-29 11:59:05	voidead	ah ok let me see
2015-11-29 11:59:13	choki	suffix is empty by default
2015-11-29 11:59:14	sim642	now I have to revert my configuration...
2015-11-29 11:59:15	--	````````` is now known as cgt
2015-11-29 11:59:33	voidead	ah ok I see what you mean
2015-11-29 11:59:48	voidead	yeah and it comes _right_ after the nick
2015-11-29 11:59:59	sim642	voidead, put a space in there
2015-11-29 11:59:59	voidead	yeah I think that may be what I'm looking for

2015-11-29 12:01:08	sim642	choki, prefix_suffix and nick_suffix do slightly different things
2015-11-29 12:01:35	voidead	also the color changed to green
2015-11-29 12:01:46	sim642	nick_suffix is really supposed to be used for when you disable alignment and want <> around nicks
2015-11-29 12:01:47	voidead	not an issue.. but I wonder how to change it back
2015-11-29 12:01:52	sim642	but it works with alignment too
2015-11-29 12:02:14	sim642	voidead, color.chat_nick_suffix
2015-11-29 12:02:42	sim642	by default prefix_suffix has that same green color too
2015-11-29 12:03:35	voidead	well I changed it at some point
2015-11-29 12:03:37	voidead	anyways

2015-11-29 15:36:54	@FlashCode	yes, just the default is the value from your file, not the default that weechat has set when creating the bar
2015-11-29 15:37:09	squirrel	what's the reason of keeping default values in config files? :s
2015-11-29 15:37:30	@FlashCode	this is because there are no options/bars by default
2015-11-29 15:37:39	@FlashCode	so when weechat loads bars, it reads the values as default
2015-11-29 15:37:50	@FlashCode	bars are completely dynamic, you can rename/delete/change them
2015-11-29 15:38:31	@FlashCode	another way would be to display that there's no default value
2015-11-29 15:38:37	@FlashCode	but not done like this
2015-11-29 15:39:25	squirrel	i still don't get it. why not write default value when you write description?
2015-11-29 15:39:40	@FlashCode	ok let me explain a bit more then
2015-11-29 15:39:47	squirrel	or was it 0 at some point and then changed to not 0?
2015-11-29 15:40:02	@FlashCode	all options (except bars) are hardcoded in source, and created each time .conf is read
2015-11-29 15:40:15	@FlashCode	such options have default in source code, and current value comes from the .conf
2015-11-29 15:40:37	@FlashCode	the bars are created just one time, on first run (bars are added with all their options just one time)
2015-11-29 15:40:50	@FlashCode	on next runs, bars are read in file, but they have no option from source file
2015-11-29 15:40:52	@FlashCode	so no default value
2015-11-29 15:41:11	@FlashCode	it would be possible to search for the default value though, with some extra code
2015-11-29 15:41:27	@FlashCode	ie look at bar name, and search in code for the value that was initially set

2015-11-29 15:42:15	@FlashCode	for bars, the default value is hard to be set, due to the way bars are created
2015-11-29 15:42:22	@FlashCode	not sure if you understand what I mean :p
2015-11-29 15:42:23	squirrel	yeah, but when the bars are created, aren't the default values also created?
2015-11-29 15:42:40	@FlashCode	yes they are
2015-11-29 15:42:46	@FlashCode	so during first run, bar defaults are ok
2015-11-29 15:42:49	@FlashCode	on next run, they are lost
2015-11-29 15:43:14	@FlashCode	I mean I can not just say .size of a bar is always 1 by default
2015-11-29 15:43:16	@FlashCode	because it depends on the bar
2015-11-29 15:43:31	@FlashCode	so when reading the .conf, I can not know the real default value of this bar
2015-11-29 15:43:42	squirrel	uhhh
2015-11-29 15:43:44	@FlashCode	especially because you can rename bars or change them (the contents, properties)
2015-11-29 15:43:50	squirrel	but how can you know the description, then?
2015-11-29 15:44:03	@FlashCode	the description is generic
2015-11-29 15:44:10	@FlashCode	.size is always the size of the bar, whatever the bar
2015-11-29 15:44:26	@FlashCode	but the default value depends on the bar, and it's not stored anywhere
2015-11-29 15:44:50	@FlashCode	in fact for .bar options, weechat should not display default at all
2015-11-29 15:44:54	@FlashCode	this would be more accurate
2015-11-29 15:45:03	@FlashCode	because it's not known
2015-11-29 15:45:12	squirrel	my understanding is not at 100% but it's more than 0% now :)
2015-11-29 15:45:29	@FlashCode	current behavior is to show the value loaded from .conf, which could be sometimes useful if you play with options, and want to restore the bar like it was on startup
2015-11-29 15:46:04	@FlashCode	for example if you do /unset weechat.bar.status.*  it will restore the bar like it was on startup (not on first weechat run!)
2015-11-29 15:46:29	@FlashCode	this let you do a reset or bars after playing with values
2015-11-29 15:46:49	@FlashCode	maybe then weechat should just display a different text than "default value" for bars
2015-11-29 15:46:55	@FlashCode	something like "value read from config"
2015-11-29 15:47:49	squirrel	but I didn't rename the bars or anything. shouldn't I have something other than 0?

2015-11-29 19:51:22	gb	you can also try starting with -s to prevent scripts loading which might be causing you issues
2015-11-29 19:52:00	sybariten2	gb saw your comment about ddos now ... also i didnt understand the "cb plugin" part
2015-11-29 19:53:45	gb	vague information, means i have to guess probably wrongly thereby sending you on a wild goose chase which i do not like doing even when the crystall ball plugin is working and i guess correctly

2015-11-29 19:56:51	gb	my best guess is you have been trying to connect to chat.freenode.net which seemed to be having issues, i use irc.freenode.net and although it dropped it never stayed down
2015-11-29 19:57:06	sybariten2	ive never understood how to vcheck version from inside weechat actually.... but it can be done i suppose?`

2015-11-29 19:57:18	Mikaela	irc.freenode.net is an alias for chat.freenode.net.

2015-11-29 19:57:22	gb	yup /v -o

2015-11-29 21:15:40	xvn	how do i make whois, nickserv, whoas, etc lookups display in the active buffer, rather than the server buffer?
2015-11-29 21:16:19	@FlashCode	xvn: you can change target buffer of some irc commands, see user's guide: https://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_user.en.html#irc_target_buffer
2015-11-29 21:16:34	xvn	thank you
2015-11-29 21:16:36	@FlashCode	but by default, output of commands is on server buffer, so that user messages are not mixed with other output
2015-11-29 21:16:53	@FlashCode	(and then log files are separated, and not polluted by other messages)

2015-11-29 21:20:06	gb	or too much coding to do it?

2015-11-30 11:27:11	Fernando-Basso	 aspell is not installed (openbsd). Is it possible to install it, or weechat must be recompiled?
2015-11-30 11:27:43	@FlashCode	Fernando-Basso: you can install it and you'll have to compile weechat aspell plugin
2015-11-30 11:28:02	@FlashCode	then once you did make / make install, you can do in weechat: /plugin load aspell

2015-11-30 11:31:00	gb	if compiled in and you have not modified the plugin autoload aspell should be loaded on weechat start
2015-11-30 11:31:25	gb	but you will still need to configure dictonaries outside of weechat for it

2015-11-30 23:20:17	Raku	Like for example
2015-11-30 23:20:23	Raku	I have a clock in my input bar
2015-11-30 23:20:38	Raku	And it's squished in the left with all the other items
2015-11-30 23:20:40	gb	thanks flash it works brilliantly
2015-11-30 23:21:06	Raku	Ah
2015-11-30 23:21:15	Raku	Nvm looks like it's planned for 1.4 already
2015-11-30 23:21:20	gb	if only i had my remote trigger command setup so i could apply it to my dev client from here
2015-11-30 23:21:21	@FlashCode	Raku: you mean item alignment?
2015-11-30 23:21:25	Raku	Yes
2015-11-30 23:21:47	@FlashCode	it was scheduled for 1.4, just shifted it in 1.5
2015-11-30 23:21:52	Raku	Ah
2015-11-30 23:21:54	@FlashCode	and no idea if ever I could do that in 1.5 :/
2015-11-30 23:22:09	Raku	Is it just low priority or difficult to implement?
2015-11-30 23:22:29	sim642	item alignment in what sense?
2015-11-30 23:22:30	@FlashCode	both, or.. none even :D
2015-11-30 23:22:37	@FlashCode	just no time to implement it
2015-11-30 23:22:50	gb	hehe the cryptic flash :)
2015-11-30 23:22:54	@FlashCode	sim642: align some items to the right for example
2015-11-30 23:22:59	@FlashCode	or centered in bar
2015-11-30 23:23:07	sim642	oh like that
2015-11-30 23:23:11	@FlashCode	anyway, this is something difficult to implement
2015-11-30 23:23:17	gb	ie to put clock in far right corner
2015-11-30 23:23:19	@FlashCode	due to the way bars are currently dispayed
2015-11-30 23:23:29	Raku	Ah
2015-11-30 23:23:33	sim642	also all the cases need to be handler where things don't fit
2015-11-30 23:23:42	Raku	So you'd have to rework the way bars work to use it?
2015-11-30 23:23:42	@FlashCode	yes not easy
2015-11-30 23:23:54	Raku	s/use/add
2015-11-30 23:24:04	gb	it's a common request over the years
2015-11-30 23:24:10	@FlashCode	and even if it fits, it would add many checks/computations to know where things must be displayed (ie it will slow down display)
2015-11-30 23:24:25	sim642	I once thought about starting to work on bar autoscrolling (for buffers.pl and such)
2015-11-30 23:24:31	@FlashCode	and display is already something slow in some cases
2015-11-30 23:24:32	sim642	according to the proposal I made in some issue
2015-11-30 23:24:32	Raku	Hm, makes sense
2015-11-30 23:24:35	gb	and possibly worse break badly

2015-11-30 23:25:23	Raku	Don't think of it as weechat crashing
2015-11-30 23:25:27	sim642	and bars don't have any simulation things right now unlike some other gui things
2015-11-30 23:25:28	gb	of course :)

2015-12-01 00:45:09	mumixam	casue i just ran the your /set line without issues
2015-12-01 00:45:11	ArchNoob	not really.
2015-12-01 00:45:50	ArchNoob	i don't have a server named oftc i thought it's part of the process. didn't know it should be a server name mux
2015-12-01 00:45:58	ArchNoob	mumixam: ^^
2015-12-01 00:46:19	mumixam	yea i was thinking oftc was a default server
2015-12-01 00:46:30	mumixam	but if u dont have a server named that add the server 1st
2015-12-01 00:46:35	mumixam	/help server
2015-12-01 00:46:52	KrillBat	You need to ##/server add oftc ircserver.address.org:6697
2015-12-01 00:47:24	KrillBat	Obvs you want to replace ircserver.address.org
2015-12-01 00:47:33	KrillBat	with the address of the server you want to connect to
2015-12-01 00:47:38	ArchNoob	aah thank you. and what about command? as the line is /set irc.server.oftc.command what is the command?
2015-12-01 00:47:41	KrillBat	and 6697 connects via ssl
2015-12-01 00:48:03	KrillBat	I don't understand your question
2015-12-01 00:48:27	KrillBat	but if you want to connect sans ssl, the regular port is 6667 usually
2015-12-01 00:49:15	ArchNoob	what do i put in the word command? it's irc.server.oftc."command" do i put the word command as is?
2015-12-01 00:49:38	KrillBat	What are you trying to do?

2015-12-01 00:51:48	ArchNoob	when i write /help secure, in examples, there is "encrypt oftc password for nickserver" that is the place i'm trying to complete.
2015-12-01 00:52:14	KrillBat	I've never used /secure, I'm sorry
2015-12-01 00:52:35	KrillBat	I will look at it though
2015-12-01 00:53:04	ArchNoob	Well, perhaps you could help with what plugin you are using

2015-12-01 21:03:55	gb	oh does xdg-open get round the issues of finding x from screen?
2015-12-01 21:05:02	gb	i quite likethe www-browser ption though maybe you could have w for that x for xdg-open, etc

2015-12-01 21:06:16	sim642	from within screen, that is
2015-12-01 21:06:18	gb	or w fr wget, lynx, firefox, etc all first letter launchers from it depending on the url displayed and what you need to do from weechat
2015-12-01 21:06:53	sim642	gb, if you need all those different options, make multiple copies for the trigger :P
2015-12-01 21:07:01	gb	cool i might check it out if i get bored enough :)
2015-12-01 21:08:00	gb	isn't it just an extra context binding to the trigger?

2015-12-01 21:12:20	gb	sim would xdg-open work in cygwin i wonder?
2015-12-01 21:12:24	Zarthus	is it right to assume the following is wrong?:
2015-12-01 21:12:24	Zarthus	 =!= │ Warning: WeeChat is running under screen and $TERM is "xterm-256color", which can cause display bugs; $TERM should be set to one of these values: screen-256color, screen
2015-12-01 21:12:24	Zarthus	 =!= │ You should add this line in the file ~/.screenrc:  term screen-256color
2015-12-01 21:12:24	Zarthus	`term` doesn't work (from the CLI - might work from the screenrc) (but TERM=screen-256color does)
2015-12-01 21:13:45	gb	Zarthus: you need to export TERM not term
2015-12-01 21:13:50	sim642	well, if you run it under screen, use screen-256color
2015-12-01 21:14:02	Zarthus	yeah, but the second line sent by weechat seems like a wrong command
2015-12-01 21:14:22	sim642	it doesn't need to work from the CLI, it's a screen command
2015-12-01 21:14:28	sim642	you put it into .screenrc as said
2015-12-01 21:14:44	Zarthus	alright, I thought screenrc was just a basic bash script that was being executed
2015-12-01 21:14:57	gb	nope
2015-12-01 21:15:23	gb	maybe read man .screenrc
2015-12-01 21:15:26	Zarthus	would explain why previous attempts at setting it to screne-256color might not've worked
2015-12-01 21:16:09	Zarthus	but yeah, i'll roll with that. thanks
2015-12-01 21:16:21	gb	you can also /set environment stuff inside weechat for testing things, etc but best to configure your .screenrc/whatever properly
2015-12-01 21:16:50	Zarthus	yep, I agree. It just looked a bit odd to me since I've been used to using export/TERM=...
2015-12-01 21:16:52	gb	screen-256color has to be spelt correctly too :)
2015-12-01 21:17:01	Zarthus	hehe ^^

I thought with /layout store it would store this setup. however when I quit and restart it nicely opens the vertical split layout, but it does not set the buffers accordingly. what do I do wrong?

2015-12-03 01:31:57	gb	if it says you need to add a fingerprint then make sure you plae it in the place it tells you too or it still will not function properly

2015-12-03 01:36:24	gb	i do not use ssl myself though

2015-12-03 20:31:31	Honeyclaw	hi all! I've been using weechat for a while and it's awesome. I'm looking at making a simple relay client to run on my linux workstation to run notify-send when I recieve a highlight or query
2015-12-03 20:32:10	cgt	there are scripts for that sort of stuff
2015-12-03 20:32:50	Honeyclaw	cgt: if you have a link that'd be great. all the scripts I see to do remote notifications expect weechat to be able to push them out to the machine getting the notification
2015-12-03 20:33:09	cgt	oh, well that's what I meant, sorry

2015-12-03 20:33:59	Honeyclaw	:D no prob. to be clear I want to use the relay since my workstation is behind a firewall (and weechat runs on my VPS), so the pub/sub model seems better in that regard
2015-12-03 20:34:31	cgt	yeah, that makes sense
2015-12-03 20:34:50	Honeyclaw	I'm reading through http://www.weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_relay_protocol.en.html but would like to know if there are some example programs that demonstrate connections to the relay port

2015-12-03 20:42:37	Honeyclaw	cgt: that's exactly what I plan to do, but having a "hello world" around is nice, so I figured I'd come and ask
2015-12-03 20:43:04	Honeyclaw	oh, actually there's a section "typical session" on that page I linked. I just telnetted to the relay port, plugged in "init password=xxxxx" and then "ping 123"
2015-12-03 20:43:18	Honeyclaw	... and got my "pong" in response. nice!

2015-12-03 23:23:16	gb	you will need a weechat protoco relay and there is lots of examples in /help relay

2015-12-03 23:23:35	gb	are lots too :)
2015-12-03 23:25:22	hsknz	Would I be correct in saying that this setup would replace znc?
2015-12-03 23:29:56	gb	no
2015-12-03 23:30:55	gb	well yes sort of but znc uses an irc relay protocol whereas the weechat protocol gives you better control of weechat
2015-12-03 23:31:58	hsknz	so if you use the weechat proto, you are boxing yourself into using a weechat client
2015-12-03 23:32:03	gb	if you use a plain client like irssi you'd need and irc relay to make weechat behave like znc
2015-12-03 23:32:37	gb	well weechat-android can only connect to weechat anyhow

2015-12-03 23:35:17	hsknz	I think I have decided that sticking with znc would be the better option. I only recently got into weechat and was thinking that I may be able to replace znc with it

2015-12-04 01:02:06	Raku	Yep
2015-12-04 01:02:22	syba2	gb: weechat --version says just 1.3.   And i think i was without SSL originally, then suddenly got kicked off during all these ddos things, then after some days i tried with SSL ... but rencentrly turned it off.   irc.server.freenode.ssl  is boolean OFF

2015-12-04 01:03:56	gb	i do not use ssl so i'd only be guessing what your issue is
2015-12-04 01:04:16	gb	you could check in /server raw for a hint
2015-12-04 01:04:35	gb	!keys has a binding listed for it too

2015-12-04 01:05:23	gb	ir'll probably say wring fingerprint or something
2015-12-04 01:05:28	syba2	ok
2015-12-04 01:05:38	mute	probably just the servers that it resolves to are broke. freenode's dns only gave me 2 servers for chat.freenode.net
2015-12-04 01:05:51	syba2	i dont really see those sha error outputs right now though...  but then again , ssl is turned off
2015-12-04 01:05:55	gb	it's default key bindings so you do not need to type /server raw

2015-12-05 23:06:28	HSaka	nils_2: I just downloaded the latest stable few hours ago. I just found out it was the terminals reason (i am using oSX)

2015-12-06 01:06:54	gb	Aelius: technically you do not have to delete the bar
2015-12-06 01:07:19	gb	you could make a new bar with a different name and type
2015-12-06 01:07:20	Aelius	I tried deleting it and it was instantly recreated, so I edited it from the config and restarted weechat
2015-12-06 01:08:04	gb	then your method of deletion was obviously incorrect

2015-12-06 01:09:13	Aelius	like I said, weechat automatically recreated it
2015-12-06 01:09:38	Aelius	so it wasn't effective, as I couldnt change the type
2015-12-06 01:10:21	gb	i have no tried it recently but it worked fine for me back on .3.2
2015-12-06 01:10:50	gb	back when i wanted to make weechat more like irssi
2015-12-06 01:11:06	gb	i've since realised it was a bad idea
2015-12-06 01:11:41	Aelius	I may have inadvertantly done this
2015-12-06 01:14:12	gb	i'm not sure why you'd want to hange type of an existing bar but it is trivial to follow exampls in /help to create additional bars and insert the items from the old bar into it if you need a different type or placement of bar depending on buffer or window conditions, etc
2015-12-06 01:15:22	gb	i even created a bar to give me extra space until i found seperator being turned on was more effective for giving me a clearer readable title and buffers bars

2015-12-06 01:16:17	shadowtail	a vertical monitor guy
2015-12-06 01:16:31	Raku	We don't like your kind around here
2015-12-06 01:16:32	Aelius	no, not really
2015-12-06 01:16:39	 *	Raku spits on the ground and scowls at Aelius
2015-12-06 01:16:47	Aelius	what makes you think I do vertical monitor?
2015-12-06 01:17:01	 *	shadowtail turns away in disgust
2015-12-06 01:17:43	Aelius	anyway, I've never used multiple windows before, I don't think I like it
2015-12-06 01:17:55	Raku	Good
2015-12-06 01:18:03	Raku	Escape while you don't have an 8 window split
2015-12-06 01:18:19	Aelius	vertical splits are too annoying and invasive because they require turning nicklist off and probably right alignment of nicks
2015-12-06 01:18:35	Raku	I have one big root bar for nicks on the right
2015-12-06 01:18:40	Raku	And shows nicks of active window
2015-12-06 01:18:49	Aelius	that makes sense
2015-12-06 01:19:23	Aelius	irssi trained me to not care about  nick bars, but weechat's /names output is godawful
2015-12-06 01:20:11	Raku	Oh lord
2015-12-06 01:20:37	Raku	That'd be nice if it came out in it's own buffer
2015-12-06 01:20:56	gb	i care about neither but offline colouring is helpful to not replying to nicks departed providing some of their chat is still on screen
2015-12-06 01:21:43	Aelius	I'm not sure which came first, the irssi script or the weechat feature, but irssi has that
2015-12-06 01:21:56	Aelius	(I could say that about most features)
2015-12-06 01:22:49	Aelius	irssi also trained me to not care about multiple windows because irssi windowing uses a rarer form of logic known only by the developers that programmed it
2015-12-06 01:23:44	shadowtail	are you saying you are irssi dev
2015-12-06 01:23:54	Aelius	god no
2015-12-06 01:24:03	gb	i agree target_buffer does need a create new and write to a setable named buffer option
2015-12-06 01:24:57	gb	instead of server,current,pv
2015-12-06 01:24:59	Aelius	I managed to create one window split for highlights in irssi, and 4 times a year I would encounter a bug where #channels would start to go into the split and nothing I did would get them out
2015-12-06 01:25:23	Aelius	irssi's concept of "stickyness" and general movement logic is rooted firmly in insanity
2015-12-06 01:25:56	gb	lets not read about irsi's faults please
2015-12-06 01:26:23	gb	leave that for #irssi
2015-12-06 01:27:06	Aelius	gb: that's a trap though. Because if you  bring it up, they'll say "oh, but it's quite simple! <incomprehensible>"
2015-12-06 01:27:55	gb	i have no idea who "they" are and do not really care

2015-12-06 05:03:47	@FlashCode	or the command is /window scroll_bottom
2015-12-06 05:06:01	sparr	thanks. alt+end isn't making it through my connection to weechat, but the command works
2015-12-06 05:17:59	gb	sparr: esc end if your alt is borked
2015-12-06 05:18:43	gb	alt/esc u to scrollup to the unread line
2015-12-06 05:19:51	gb	lotsa chtter bout a bookmark for when you want to scrollup/down in a buffer but nothing serious yet on the drawing board that i'm aware of
2015-12-06 05:21:31	gb	if you recently upgraded from a very old wee you might need to do /key missing but please read /help key for the right command in case my typizt mucked up

2015-12-06 22:21:02	thorwell	I think some program i needed help with had it's channel on dal.net

2015-12-07 01:15:47	meingtsla	Interesting. What are your iptables rules? May want to tcpdump next time it happens and then see if any return traffic is coming back to you on the failed connection attempt
2015-12-07 01:17:24	ansch	dont think it could be anything from my iptables, but its def worth a try
2015-12-07 01:19:31	meingtsla	Another possibility: Was it attempting to connect using ipv6 the first time and ipv4 the second time, or with ipv4 both times?

2015-12-09 20:36:18	bweeze	hey guys, I've been trying to chase down this problem, I guess it's 'error 104: connection reset by peer' when trying to connect to a server, I've been looking around on line and cant find anything that is similar to my issue
2015-12-09 20:36:37	bweeze	"irc: reading data on socket: error 104 Connection reset by peer"

2015-12-09 20:38:23	bweeze	everything i'm finding is about python not accepting connections in scripts or stuff like that

2015-12-09 20:38:59	bweeze	it's there, I'm using xchat and I'm connected there
2015-12-09 20:39:48	Mikaela	works here. it seems to be a round-robin so maybe your WeeChat attempted connecting to server that was down?
2015-12-09 20:39:49	Mikaela	XChat is not developed anymore and has multiple issues like missing SASL support and not supporting TLS (which means you cannot connect to most of networks and bouncers). You can use your current config with HexChat (instructions: http://goo.gl/qqnBsh). HexChat's homepage: http://goo.gl/HIQ6V0
2015-12-09 20:40:48	bweeze	ya, I know it's shit, thats why i'm trying to set up weechat lol, did a fresh install of xubuntu 15.*, I havent had this issue with any other system

2015-12-12 20:14:24	esph	Hmm, just realized that this is partly due to a bad workflow I have with weechat: I like to be able to quickly check the starting point of messages I haven't yet read in a buffer I'm following, so I end up parking myself in a different buffer when I stop reading for a bit. This allows me to use the nice pink dashed line to see where I left off.
2015-12-12 20:17:08	esph	However, what I should really be doing is using the pink line directly instead of changing buffers just to make the pink line on the buffer I'm actually interested in. Is there a way to manually put the dashed line on the buffer you're viewing?
2015-12-12 20:17:52	esph	Or is there a completely different way I should be doing this?

2015-12-13 01:59:14	kichuku	could someone please tell me how I can leave one channel alone
2015-12-13 01:59:31	kichuku	while continuing to stay in other channels that I have joined
2015-12-13 02:02:48	squirrel	don't leave channels alone, they get lonely and leak memory^Wtears
2015-12-13 02:03:21	kichuku	squirrel: haha
2015-12-13 02:03:24	thunderbolt	Do you mean switch buffers?
2015-12-13 02:04:04	kichuku	I mean suppose I have joined channel #freenode,#weechat,#linux etc
2015-12-13 02:04:32	kichuku	I want to leave #weechat. But I want to continue to be in #linux
2015-12-13 02:04:38	Ellenor	kichuku: just /part #weechat
2015-12-13 02:05:04	squirrel	or /buffer close
2015-12-13 02:05:11	kichuku	Ellenor: it still stays in the buffer
2015-12-13 02:05:29	kichuku	ok. so I type /buffer close #channelname ?
2015-12-13 02:05:57	Ellenor	kichuku: /buffer close in the buffer that's parted
2015-12-13 02:06:18	squirrel	well what he typed should work too
2015-12-13 02:06:45	kichuku	ok that works

2015-12-13 02:07:19	squirrel	congrats, now channel is not alone, you killeded it
2015-12-13 02:08:01	kichuku	but /buffer close #channelname doesn't work though
2015-12-13 02:08:47	squirrel	guess has to be full name
2015-12-13 02:08:58	Ellenor	ugh
2015-12-13 02:09:04	kichuku	yes I tried with full name
2015-12-13 02:09:23	Ellenor	mah
2015-12-13 02:09:32	kichuku	if I go to that channel and then type /buffer close, then it works
2015-12-13 02:09:52	squirrel	full name as in irc.freenode.#gaybros
2015-12-13 02:09:59	kichuku	oh
2015-12-13 02:10:11	kichuku	no I didn't try it like that
2015-12-13 02:10:20	squirrel	you can also close by number
2015-12-13 02:10:39	squirrel	/help buffer, anyway
2015-12-13 02:10:53	kichuku	squirrel: full name works
2015-12-13 02:11:05	squirrel	woo!
2015-12-13 02:11:29	kichuku	and buffer number works too
2015-12-13 02:11:36	squirrel	woo woo!

2015-12-13 15:54:25	gb	i suspect like you already said buffer_autoset would be your best option but not used it for that myself
2015-12-13 15:55:21	Caelum	I guess a trigger would also work
2015-12-13 15:55:32	Caelum	hi gb
2015-12-13 15:59:13	sim642	emerson, you can, any script or trigger can handle it if it desires to
2015-12-13 15:59:31	sim642	it's just that most people would find it more annoying than useful to see that
2015-12-13 16:00:17	emerson	ah, okay
2015-12-13 16:01:06	emerson	how would you target those messages with a trigger? /trigger monitor shows no tags for them
2015-12-13 16:01:27	sim642	only displayed lines can have tags
2015-12-13 16:01:49	sim642	to have a trigger handle ACCOUNT, you'll need a signal hook on *,irc_in2_ACCOUNT
2015-12-13 16:02:30	sim642	within the trigger you can call the /print command to display it in some buffer
2015-12-13 16:03:01	sim642	Caelum, and what is the point of that script?
2015-12-13 16:03:27	emerson	cool, thanks

2015-12-13 20:18:35	squirrel	while we are talking about this
2015-12-13 20:18:48	sim642	there are ways to add them to highlight_words but not highlight_tags I think
2015-12-13 20:18:48	squirrel	what is the difference betweel localvars and properties?
2015-12-13 20:19:03	sim642	I suspect the reason being that there's two ways to combine tags
2015-12-13 20:19:10	sim642	AND & OR
2015-12-13 20:19:22	sim642	squirrel, properties?
2015-12-13 20:20:00	squirrel	yeah, you can use /buffer set and /buffer get to set and get properties
2015-12-13 20:20:10	squirrel	and there are localvars

2015-12-13 20:28:09	sim642	they're all buffer properties
2015-12-13 20:28:32	sim642	localvars are a subset of them which can be freely created by scripts

2015-12-13 20:46:53	sim642	according to all documentation it *should* work
2015-12-13 20:47:08	sim642	too busy with metadata-3.2 right now to have a deeper look at that
2015-12-13 20:47:33	squirrel	is buffer's localvar "name" the same as property "name"?
2015-12-13 20:47:47	squirrel	it looks like these are different
2015-12-13 20:48:20	sim642	well internally they have different names too
2015-12-13 20:48:32	sim642	the property is just called "name", the localvar would be called "localvar_name"
2015-12-13 20:48:47	squirrel	what's the latter used for?

2015-12-13 21:27:00	Oddish	preferably in a format i can paste into another weechat session, if possible.  if not, I can use some regex-fu to reformat it.
2015-12-13 21:27:17	sim642	just transfer the config files themselves?
2015-12-13 21:27:44	Oddish	I don't want to clobber every setting, just the ones that match *color*

2015-12-14 21:00:29	KaiSforza	Alright, so I've noticed that when I go to change passwords or things that weechat sees as passwords, the characters it displays are not just '/set foo.bar.password ********', but instead just '$1$.*+'. Does anyone know how to disable password censoring entirely? It seems like this should only be doing this when messaging nickserv.
2015-12-14 21:01:26	ikuria	didnt get the trigger right to exec nofity-send when a new query buffer is opened :(
2015-12-14 21:01:27	@nils_2	/trigger restore
2015-12-14 21:01:46	@nils_2	i guess you updated your weechat and trigger changed in past, KaiSforza
2015-12-14 21:03:00	KaiSforza	nils_2: so it's a /trigger that does the password starring? that doesn't sound right...

2015-12-14 21:07:14	sim642	you can't directly pop ${tg_message} or something as the text though

2015-12-14 21:41:26	sim642	nils_2, irc_pv_opened would be a more direct signal to work with

2015-12-14 21:42:55	@nils_2	but what happens if its not irc?
2015-12-14 21:43:17	sim642	then it's not a PV, it could be anything opening a buffer

2015-12-14 21:44:53	sim642	checking of a buffer is a query buffer via condition seems a lot less trivial

2015-12-14 22:03:19	semeion	sim642: no
2015-12-14 22:03:23	sim642	squirrel, buffer type is a variable indicating whether it's a formatted or free content buffer
2015-12-14 22:04:05	ikuria	sim642: works on query open but i think buffer.full_name is wrong, its not the query, its the active buffer
2015-12-14 22:04:33	semeion	sim642: do you know where is this package in archlinux?
2015-12-14 22:05:02	sim642	semeion, sorry, don't know about arch but it should be as accessible as weechat package itself
2015-12-14 22:05:27	sim642	ikuria, hmm, the signal says it gives a buffer pointer argument
2015-12-14 22:05:44	squirrel	sim642: but there's a localvar
2015-12-14 22:05:58	sim642	oh wait, I think you need to do: ${tg_signal_data.full_name} or something
2015-12-14 22:06:17	 *	ikuria wait
2015-12-14 22:06:19	ikuria	:D
2015-12-14 22:06:31	sim642	or something more complex even
2015-12-14 22:06:40	sim642	${buffer[${tg_signal_data}].full_name}
2015-12-14 22:06:57	sim642	that example is also given in trigger documentation
2015-12-14 22:07:11	sim642	so yes, that's how it should access the properties of the correct buffer
2015-12-14 22:07:14	squirrel	w-a uses buffer type to determine if it's a private window or not and we had no complaints :p
2015-12-14 22:07:33	sim642	w-a?
2015-12-14 22:07:39	squirrel	weechat-android

2015-12-15 22:53:04	Neko-chan	And I thought I was saving everything
2015-12-15 22:53:34	@nils_2	/save will save *all* configs, from all loaded plugins too

2015-12-15 22:55:30	Neko-chan	nils_2: even when I /load or /reload nothing came back. Is there another way I should be saving in order to prevent future tragedy?
2015-12-15 22:55:44	Zarthus	Fusl: Because I notice you're connecting through ZNC via both IRCCloud and WeeChat, which might be why you're getting WHOISes from other clients.
2015-12-15 22:56:37	Zarthus	znc's route_replies can fix this to great amount, but it's not flawless. It should help at least.
2015-12-15 22:56:38	@nils_2	Neko-chan: weechat loads the config automatically. normally its not necessary to use the /reload command

2015-12-16 23:05:37	choki	i wonder if i can toggle window layouts this way
2015-12-16 23:05:56	ruok	I meant the command to see if a bind exists
2015-12-16 23:06:11	choki	ruok: it is meta-k

2015-12-16 23:07:52	Mooash	sim642: I am sorry, yes. Scripts. Reading here https://www.weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#secured_data I'm starting to think they can't?
2015-12-16 23:08:02	SpeakY10k	gb?
2015-12-16 23:08:25	sim642	Mooash, well, you can evaluate the expression ${sec.data.xxx} to get the content
2015-12-16 23:08:32	choki	Mooash: why they can't? just replace settings values with secure variables
2015-12-16 23:09:12	Mooash	Yeah, I'm trying that but it doesn't seem to be working. The plugin seems to be using the raw ${sec.data.xxx}

2015-12-16 23:10:17	sim642	because the script needs to evaluate the variable to get the value
2015-12-16 23:10:22	sim642	but most variables are not evaluated
2015-12-16 23:10:25	sim642	especially in scripts
2015-12-16 23:11:00	choki	is there still no "flush" command in weechat builtin to reset nick name colors?
2015-12-16 23:11:19	Mooash	So scripts do need to evaluate the variable before running? Weechat doesn't pass it raw to them?
2015-12-16 23:11:22	sim642	choki, reset how?
2015-12-16 23:11:31	sim642	Mooash, well, it's up to the script
2015-12-16 23:11:37	choki	sorry pls go on with Mooash first :D
2015-12-16 23:11:42	sim642	that script just reads the option and uses it, doesn't evaluate
2015-12-16 23:11:56	choki	sim642 and Mooash have the same nick colors in my client currently
2015-12-16 23:11:57	sim642	for the secure data to get in place there, it needs to be evaluated
2015-12-16 23:12:01	sim642	and the script must do it on their side
2015-12-16 23:12:15	sim642	choki, add more nick colors or set forced color for some

2015-12-16 23:12:20	sim642	because there's no reset
2015-12-16 23:12:32	sim642	because the hash function will still be the same and calculate the same colors

2015-12-16 23:26:49	sim642	from what I see there is just takes the nick, hashes it and puts the color based on that
2015-12-16 23:26:55	squirrel	it minimizes color collisions in recently spoken nicknames or sth
2015-12-16 23:27:03	sim642	which is exactly what weechat does, only with a different faster hash function
2015-12-16 23:27:24	sim642	the undeterministic color setting in there is pure random...
2015-12-16 23:27:50	squirrel	well..
2015-12-16 23:27:54	squirrel	maybe :s

2015-12-17 22:37:27	sim642	does it work after /mouse disable ?
2015-12-17 22:38:01	sim642	could be that iterm2 disables some of its own things when in mouse mode for the program it's running
2015-12-17 22:39:17	BarryAllen	yes, it works after /mouse disable
2015-12-17 22:39:45	sim642	so that's it
2015-12-17 22:39:58	sim642	would you still want to have weechat in mouse mode?
2015-12-17 22:41:40	sim642	if you do, you could look into trying out a trigger and keybind which could replace it in mouse mode

2015-12-17 22:42:01	sim642	might need the browser command to be changed though on OSX

2015-12-17 23:28:44	Ellenor	axk4545: sometimes. It's advisable to do /save before closing the client if you can.

2015-12-18 21:14:20	@nils_2	correct
2015-12-18 21:15:45	@nils_2	but it sounds like a script error
2015-12-18 21:16:05	axion	scrolling up in this channel and i noticed it for a few nicks here too
2015-12-18 21:17:57	@FlashCode	I would be very surprised of nick color bug in weechat, I'm almost sure it's caused by a script
2015-12-18 21:18:12	@FlashCode	it could only happen if you play with nick colors options
2015-12-18 21:19:02	axion	well the bug is, that for _some_ nicks that are colored yellow in chat, they appear as a different color in actual messages (like completing)
2015-12-18 21:20:06	@FlashCode	by default there are no colors for nicks in input
2015-12-18 21:20:14	@FlashCode	so if there's a bug there, it's only caused by a script
2015-12-18 21:20:19	@nils_2	you should remove that script too :-D
2015-12-18 21:20:22	axion	not input, but channel messages
2015-12-18 21:20:41	@FlashCode	there are no colors for nicks inside messages as well (only the prefix of lines have color)
2015-12-18 21:21:01	@nils_2	maybe you have a trigger installed?
2015-12-18 21:21:54	axion	no triggers, but here is a screenshot

2015-12-18 22:57:48	choki	Karthick: you compiled weechat yourself?
2015-12-18 22:58:18	@nils_2	the script you tried to install (coords.pl) needs some additional perl modules
2015-12-18 22:58:24	choki	Karthick: on ubuntu/debian/mint you may need to also install weechat-plugins from apt-get
2015-12-18 22:58:24	@nils_2	Text::CharWidth module

2015-12-19 11:44:41	Mikaela	title.py makes it show the current buffer name and highlighted buffers in it
2015-12-19 11:45:16	gb	i prefer title.py no mucking around but not all terms support it
2015-12-19 11:46:24	sim642	the support really comes from weechat itself because title.py just calls an API function
2015-12-19 11:46:38	sim642	which tries to guess which escape it should use to set the title
2015-12-19 11:46:52	sim642	based on TERM I think

2015-12-19 20:30:23	Karthick	So I guess it won't dump priv messages..
2015-12-19 20:32:58	gb	i avoid messages so no idea sorry  but i know for certain all my buffers highlights end up in highmon

2015-12-20 11:02:01	sim642	<@FlashCode> sim642: I'm merging pull requests... from older to newer ones (so your PR are last in list :p)
2015-12-20 11:02:08	Mikaela	but DANE is the oldest and has been awaiting forever (intentionally ignoring the fact that gnutls-dane is shipped nowhere and we blame gnutls instead of weechat)
2015-12-20 11:02:08	Mikaela	:(
2015-12-20 11:02:30	Mikaela	that real name tracking might be nice though
2015-12-20 11:04:04	sesquipedalian	hmm what about https://weechat.org/scripts/source/auth.rb.html/ and setting sasl for everything even servers without sasl since that script will use it for nickserv
2015-12-20 11:05:28	MrElendig	uhm, why not just set it correctly in the first place?
2015-12-20 11:05:28	sim642	squirrel, I made a very simple test program and found out that (.)\1 works fine in pcreposix
2015-12-20 11:05:29	gb	sesquipedalian: just set your nick/passwords in /secure and add the variables as per /help secure to the relevant server sasl settings
2015-12-20 11:05:30	MrElendig	less work
2015-12-20 11:05:43	MrElendig	and if you share passwords you are doing it wrong
2015-12-20 11:05:56	sesquipedalian	i dont share passwords anywhere
2015-12-20 11:05:56	sim642	squirrel, so the problem must be somewhere between eval and pcreposix, but I'm not sure where since I just changed the include file
2015-12-20 11:06:08	squirrel	:o
2015-12-20 11:06:15	gb	better yet learn about certificates and use them instead
2015-12-20 11:06:32	MrElendig	then you can just as well set it correctly in the first place instead of relying on a script to fix it for you
2015-12-20 11:06:49	Mikaela	freenode doesn't support SASL EXTERNAL, so you must use PLAIN + CertFP for the best combination
2015-12-20 11:07:08	sesquipedalian	I am on a lot of networks other than freenode, none of them mention anything about sasl
2015-12-20 11:07:19	sesquipedalian	I will use sasl for freenode sure
2015-12-20 11:07:44	MrElendig	sesquipedalian: most that don't support sasl supports using the server password for auth
2015-12-20 11:07:50	Mikaela	sasl should be supported everywhere and on my networks the only one where it's not supported is oftc
2015-12-20 11:08:06	MrElendig	if they do have some form of nickserv/accountserv/identifyserv at all
2015-12-20 11:08:14	Mikaela	which again used to claim that SASL is deprecated by CertFP or some other nonsense

2015-12-20 11:17:26	sim642	squirrel, apparently the problem appears from the fact that the regex doesn't even compile

2015-12-20 13:58:52	sim642	there's ${buffer.full_name}

2015-12-20 14:00:02	sim642	${buffer.full_name} == irc.myserver.#mychannel
2015-12-20 14:00:24	bendem	that'd work for specific channels
2015-12-20 14:00:30	singalaut	There’s localvar type: ${type} == channel
2015-12-20 14:00:45	sim642	oh, you mean IRC channels in general, not specific
2015-12-20 14:00:53	bendem	yeah
2015-12-20 14:00:59	sim642	singalaut, does the localvar directly work in bar condition?
2015-12-20 14:01:11	singalaut	I just tested it and it works
2015-12-20 14:01:13	bendem	looks like it does
2015-12-20 14:01:14	sim642	I think you need like: ${buffer.local_variables.type}
2015-12-20 14:01:15	bendem	thanks <3
2015-12-20 14:01:24	bendem	/set weechat.bar.status.conditions "${type} == channel"
2015-12-20 14:01:54	sim642	singalaut, that's weird
2015-12-20 14:02:07	sim642	I guess triggers don't have that conveniency
2015-12-20 14:04:56	singalaut	I’m not sure what you mean. Weechat always include local variables in eval without having to use the long hdata syntax. The only problem is in certain trigger (usually signal), the ${buffer} points to current buffer instead of buffer where the signal occurs, so ${type} or other local variables don’t always have the correct values

2015-12-20 15:52:21	sim642	singalaut, I thought it'd be difficult but found a way to get around the issue
2015-12-20 15:52:43	sim642	it's possible to get access to the underlying PCRE compiled pattern from the POSIX struct it provides
2015-12-20 15:53:02	sim642	which means it's possible to call other pcre functions on it, including the one to get capture group numbers by name
2015-12-20 15:53:06	singalaut	Woo, it works https://i.imgur.com/2XzcTmf.png
2015-12-20 15:53:30	sim642	I'm not sure it's 100% standard though because it assumes pcreposix wrapper makes that available
2015-12-20 15:53:49	sim642	but since pcre is now frozen and all development happens in pcre2, I doubt that will change

2015-12-21 23:40:07	sim642	in the settings you showed you're connecting to non-SSL port and have no SSL enabled, so that shouldn't prevent things I think
2015-12-21 23:40:20	sim642	but you can just change the port to 6697 and enable SSL
2015-12-21 23:40:53	sim642	there's also ssl_verify which you can disable if you truly hate security

2015-12-22 21:20:32	sim642	hotlist is the thing in the status bar which shows which buffers have activity
2015-12-22 21:21:18	sim642	focused means your cursor is in that buffer and having text in the input means just that, having written text in the buffer's input line

2015-12-22 22:10:33	@nils_2	weechat does not add colors manually and a lot of colours are very similar. you can use the /color command and inside the color buffer alt-c for a color palette

2015-12-23 21:51:22	@FlashCode	sim642: yes, any option have a "parent_name" property, which is just the name of any other option

2015-12-23 21:52:24	@FlashCode	when you read the value it's still "null", then you have to read the parent value to get the real value

2015-12-23 22:30:08	sim642	what happens if you cause a cycle?

2015-12-23 22:30:51	@FlashCode	just one level
2015-12-23 22:31:17	@FlashCode	so if null, it will get ots own value as parent, ie null

2015-12-23 22:31:58	sim642	oh yeah, it doesn't cause problems if the value getting API itself doesn't recurse

2015-12-24 22:46:54	@FlashCode	you used an empty string

2015-12-24 22:47:43	@FlashCode	if you use an empty string, that means "read values from env"

2015-12-24 22:48:51	sim642	reading http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/locale/setlocale says that "During program startup, the equivalent of setlocale(LC_ALL, "C"); is executed before any user code is run. "

2015-12-27 20:31:09	[`-`]	gb: znc has option like we can add someone's nick like gb* and it will create a log file in their name and if he messages on the channel that I have already loggged i. It then logs his message.
2015-12-27 20:32:05	gb	you could do that with a trigger easilly enough or just grep that nick in a buffer after the fact to see what they said

2015-12-29 21:50:39	choki	then change the damn bug/crash/segfault report handling :P
2015-12-29 21:51:08	sim642	there's nothing to change, you need to run it properly for the info to be there
2015-12-29 21:51:30	sim642	non-debug builds have that info removed from the executable to decrease size dramatically and increase running speeds
2015-12-29 21:51:34	choki	i dont even know what u talkin bout, wtf gdb??? debug symbols??? if u want all that stuff create a weechat-crash-report.sh script doing all this stuff for me :P

2015-12-29 23:20:04	Johann	cryptopsy: "*y in vim should copy in X clipboard, insert should paste in weechat

2015-12-29 23:21:42	Johann	well, it works for me. It will depend on a lot of things on your side (vim compiled with X support ? your terminal correctly handle the insert key ? etc)
2015-12-29 23:21:45	cryptopsy	i know it yanked because middle clip paste it

2016-01-01 16:36:36	gb	i thought bitlee was a pseudo irc thing, not  real ircd anyhow with it's own idea of what a channel is
2016-01-01 16:36:56	[`-`]	gb: If the title is lengthy, instead of scrolling it horizontally can we have it displayed in the next line?
2016-01-01 16:37:27	gb	sure just increase the number of lines it has
2016-01-01 16:37:52	gb	i forget the setting but their is also a max for each bar
2016-01-01 16:39:15	gb	try /iset weechat.bar.title.size
2016-01-01 16:41:30	gb	this is ugly but can wrap the title if you /set weechat.bar.title.size 0
2016-01-01 16:41:59	gb	then set max to 2/3 whatever you want it limited too
2016-01-01 16:42:25	gb	i prefer 1 and scrolling with mouse though

2016-01-01 17:27:13	michalrus	Hey, so I’d like to get notified about everything that happens in a channel. But when I set `/buffer set highlight_regex .*`, every nick looks the same. :( As if they were highlighting me (and, in fact, they are).
2016-01-01 17:27:37	michalrus	How can I have both different (old) nick colors and notifications?
2016-01-01 17:27:52	@FlashCode	if this is a highlight, the nick is colored
2016-01-01 17:27:58	michalrus	True.

2016-01-01 17:28:09	michalrus	How can I have notifications without highlights, then?
2016-01-01 17:28:18	@FlashCode	maybe you shouldn't highlight everything
2016-01-01 17:28:28	michalrus	That sounds sensible.
2016-01-01 17:28:29	@FlashCode	maybe a trigger then
2016-01-01 17:28:34	michalrus	Hmmm.
2016-01-01 17:28:39	@FlashCode	see /help trigger
2016-01-01 17:28:43	michalrus	Kay. :)
2016-01-01 17:28:55	@FlashCode	you can define a trigger that runs for every message of a buffer
2016-01-01 17:29:00	@FlashCode	with a condition
2016-01-01 17:29:12	michalrus	And fires a notification?
2016-01-01 17:30:11	@FlashCode	you can run any weechat command or external command (with /exec) in the trigger

2016-01-01 17:32:49	gb	notifictions are dependant very much on the dist/window manager you use but with triggers/exec you can run whatever you like regardless of dist/window manager
2016-01-01 17:33:24	michalrus	Hmmm, actually, I’m using weechat.el (Emacs relay client) to show the notifications.
2016-01-01 17:33:36	michalrus	Maybe they have to be highlights? Dunno.
2016-01-01 17:33:57	michalrus	Do you recommend something for weechat running over ssh?
2016-01-01 17:34:02	gb	so if fred said chickens you could have trigger /exec aplay chiken.wav

2016-01-01 20:35:01	voidead	so I've found some really strange problem with a irc network. I can connect to irc.b2irc.net via a VPS in weechat no problem, however, when I try to connect to that network via weechat on a home connection it doesn't work.. I know this is an inherent weechat issue as irssi connect fine.. and this is the only network that has this issue.. can someone try connecting to irc.b2irc.net via their home internet
2016-01-01 20:35:04	voidead	connection on weechat to see if they also have the same problem?
2016-01-01 20:35:51	meingtsla	voidead: irssi can connect fine from where?
2016-01-01 20:36:02	@nils_2	port? 6667?
2016-01-01 20:36:17	voidead	my home connection.. the same one weechat is trying to connect to.. yeah 6667
2016-01-01 20:36:20	meingtsla	Telnet from home to irc.b2irc.net port 6667 gives a response.

2016-01-01 20:40:00	@nils_2	maybe a user failure. i did /server add test irc.b2irc.net/6667

2016-01-01 20:54:21	meingtsla	voidead: It sounds like weechat is complaining about a certain expected IRC message not being received. If you hit alt+J alt+R, it should bring up a raw buffer showing the messages being exchanged between you and the server. Take a look at that and see if you can figure out what's not being exchanged.
2016-01-01 20:54:23	voidead	ok so the admin for the network says "we are running a standard if a bit old u2 revision.. u2 being the undernet standard"
2016-01-01 20:54:41	voidead	meingtsla, ah ok I'll look
2016-01-01 20:57:47	meingtsla	Like nils_2 though I'm not able to reproduce that issue, the connection completes
2016-01-01 20:57:59	meingtsla	(using 1.3)
2016-01-01 20:59:31	voidead	now the question is
2016-01-01 20:59:40	voidead	what is your home connection setup like
2016-01-01 20:59:49	voidead	what are you connection from

2016-01-01 20:59:58	voidead	not to pry into private info
2016-01-01 21:00:02	meingtsla	You first.
2016-01-01 21:01:18	voidead	well lets just say this much.. every person I know that is on this network (using various different irc clients) have had issues connecting and can only connect via their VPS
2016-01-01 21:02:23	voidead	furthermore.. as I said.. it can't be user error as I've been able to connect via irssi with no issues or error messages

2016-01-01 21:04:20	voidead	it is weechat
2016-01-01 21:04:28	@nils_2	use irssi
2016-01-01 21:04:35	meingtsla	Other things to rule out: home routers filtering out certain messages, bad parameters being passed causing the registration exchange to break down
2016-01-01 21:04:39	voidead	whether you can connect or not doesn't depend on the user

2016-01-01 21:17:39	voidead	the admin said there could be some compatibility issues as the servers are a bit outdated with a few things.. he has to verify later if he gets any errors using weechat
2016-01-01 21:18:54	voidead	singalaut, then lets see.. so what I've been told was there is a compatibility issue with the server.. secondly.. I should connect to a server directly.. and finally I will try setting the timeout
2016-01-01 21:19:05	meingtsla	So the ircd connects back to you to get an identd response - your connection might not be set up to respond to identd (and that's perfectly reasonable), so it has to wait until that connection attempt times out before proceeding with the connection - and while it does that weechat closes the connection prematurely, which would explain what you were seeing
2016-01-01 21:19:13	gb	oh you might need an irc:// before the nick to run it from cli like that but check man weechat if you want to try it

2016-01-01 21:47:42	Naama	That only changes the prefix color

2016-01-01 21:48:34	Naama	http://puu.sh/mg5hw/4a0ac4393d.png
2016-01-01 21:48:44	Naama	I want the actual text white
2016-01-01 21:48:51	Naama	I know, I'm terribly needy
2016-01-01 21:49:11	gb	white ewwgh
2016-01-01 21:49:52	Naama	To each their own :P
2016-01-01 21:50:00	Naama	I'm not a colorful person.
2016-01-01 21:50:45	gb	i'm a bit racist against white text and back grounds :-)
2016-01-01 21:51:21	gb	i prefer a nice dark contrast
2016-01-01 21:51:51	Naama	:P
2016-01-01 21:51:57	Naama	Well to be fair, it doesn't look white.
2016-01-01 21:52:02	Naama	It's more of a gray.
2016-01-01 21:53:15	gb	nt a fan of grey/silver either
2016-01-01 21:54:16	gb	thanks for the screenshot seems a clash of terms as often weechat refers to prefix to describe the nick in things like ctrl r, etc
2016-01-01 21:54:48	gb	so thought that was what it applied too
2016-01-01 21:55:31	gb	prefix align is another
2016-01-01 21:57:28	gb	weechat.color.chat_nick_self is something else you can play with but i think it aplies equally to actions/normal nick stuff
2016-01-01 21:58:09	Naama	Yeah
2016-01-01 21:58:16	Naama	That's the problem :P
2016-01-01 21:58:17	gb	but a trigger should be able to do what you want regardless of colour settings
2016-01-01 21:59:15	gb	sorry i misunderstood your issue
2016-01-01 22:00:49	Naama	I don't think you did :D
2016-01-01 22:02:19	Naama	But I don't understand triggers at all.

2016-01-01 22:29:41	thevishy	I think thats the main point, since weechat supports some advanced stuff wanted to see if I could remove some lines and make the buffer look good
2016-01-01 22:30:00	rivarun	what's the point of the buffer if you can't even read what people are saying?
2016-01-01 22:30:10	thevishy	they are not trolls, just bad typers :)
2016-01-01 22:30:18	rivarun	for example if i make a tpyo and then you dont know what i'm saying
2016-01-01 22:30:49	thevishy	its not all the time lets say sometimes folks use enter key a lot
2016-01-01 22:31:11	thevishy	a single word hit enter another word enter ... I get pissed off lol
2016-01-01 22:31:39	thevishy	I am like wtf is this guy doing?
2016-01-01 22:32:23	thevishy	or probably I need to adjust to that, there is no way around!

2016-01-02 17:45:48	Lyze-of-Kiel	mainly because debian are more focus on stability
2016-01-02 17:46:40	gb	some of use debian here too but we prefer to use software that is not broken/unstable then what is in the deb repo

2016-01-02 20:58:43	sdothum	i'm playing with a single bar_item that i want to give some smarts. bar_item_update only has the single parameter (callback item)..
2016-01-02 20:59:57	sdothum	weechat is pretty nifty.. just i my understanding of scripting for it is pretty shallow right now
2016-01-02 21:00:52	sim642	hook_signal is the one which allows giving it a callback data argument
2016-01-02 21:01:08	sim642	the signal handler function is given the date you specify when you create the hook
2016-01-02 21:01:16	sim642	I think it only takes pointers though
2016-01-02 21:01:46	sim642	I'm not really sure there's any example using callback data in a script

2016-01-02 21:12:37	sdothum	not sure i understand how 2 wrapper functions can ultimately reference the same bar_item_update('mybaritem') so that mybaritem knows how to behave
2016-01-02 21:13:24	sdothum	with only one bar_item_new created
2016-01-02 21:14:04	sim642	you said you want to have two hook_signals do different things (?)
2016-01-02 21:14:51	sim642	if you want to call baritem's callback differently, I don't think you can do that
2016-01-02 21:14:59	sim642	because weechat may call it anytime itself
2016-01-02 21:15:10	sim642	and then it can't have the data your script wants to provite
2016-01-02 21:15:12	sim642	provide*
2016-01-02 21:21:14	sdothum	i wrote up a tiny script to draw a line to the end of the input_text (window width) if not the current buffer. The current buffer originally was left blank (for typing in, of course).. then i started playing with it to see if it were initialized with the same dotted line, whether on keyboard input actions, i could effectively revert that bar_item to an empty string (so it wouldn't scroll across the input
2016-01-02 21:21:16	sdothum	buffer)
2016-01-02 21:24:25	sdothum	the original script was just a few lines of code. this simple exploration though got me scratching my head.

2016-01-02 23:18:49	michalrus	But how do I filter out my own messages?
2016-01-02 23:19:07	michalrus	Buffers have "nick" local variable, but ${buffer.nick} contains nothing.
2016-01-02 23:19:31	michalrus	How do I know what fields are ther in the ${buffer} object?

2016-01-02 23:20:39	michalrus	My nicks are different in different buffers, so hardcoding it is a bad idea.
2016-01-02 23:20:46	michalrus	Also, sometimes they change.
2016-01-02 23:22:02	michalrus	Also, ${buffer.full_name} suggested in the wiki page on triggers (on GitHub) contains nothing.

2016-01-02 23:28:07	michalrus	And why is .full_name empty?
2016-01-02 23:31:05	michalrus	Also, why is highlight_regex not shown in /buffet localvar, after I do /buffer set highlight_regex abc ?

2016-01-03 19:30:18	gb	might be good to put a force dpkg link to use weechat.org link on the deb page or just add it to the bottom FlashCode
2016-01-03 19:35:54	@FlashCode	gb: yes I'll add to instructions if someone confirms it's OK
2016-01-03 19:36:30	@FlashCode	for me (on debian jessie), when I add weechat.org repo, it has priority 500 by default (like standard repos), and weechat.org is always used by default (no idea why)
2016-01-03 19:36:35	@FlashCode	so I never had to play with priority
2016-01-03 19:37:31	gb	yeah i dunno, i'm still needing a new computer to test such things on :-)

2016-01-03 19:45:26	gb	fladd: are you able to confirm FlashCode advice worked ?
2016-01-03 19:48:52	gb	FlashCode: would priority depend on order of the links in sources.list or did you add it outside sources ?
2016-01-03 19:49:33	@FlashCode	I added in a file (in /etc/apt/sources.d/weechat.list)
2016-01-03 19:50:40	gb	yeah just wondering if these issues might not be caused if extra priority is given to links earlier or further down in sources if people add weechat.org in there

2016-01-04 23:48:55	bithon	it seems like i have 2 buffers on my first window: freenode and weechat one

2016-01-04 23:58:00	mosene	i don't have perl
2016-01-04 23:58:13	mosene	in .weechat
2016-01-04 23:58:17	pwnie	Can I specify exactly which server I want to connect to on a network? For example when I /connect freenode, can I somehow say I want to connect to the server tepper.freenode.net?
2016-01-04 23:58:18	mosene	just python
2016-01-04 23:58:29	pwnie	I know I can cycle through addresses with /connect -switch

2016-01-05 00:00:05	sim642	pwnie: make the server address that instead of irc.freenode.net

2016-01-05 00:00:59	pwnie	sim642: I know I could do that but I like to have multiple addresses, so thats why I would like the ability to specify what server I connect to on a network
2016-01-05 00:01:47	pwnie	Maybe this is some functionality I will have to add for myself

2016-01-07 20:25:52	sim642	they aren't once you understand how they work, the key handling just is
2016-01-07 20:27:18	@nils_2	triggers are very powerful, therefore its not that easy to use them.
2016-01-07 20:27:25	sim642	/trigger addreplace key_test signal key_combo_default "${tg_signal_data} == ${\01}[t" "" "/print -core TEST"
2016-01-07 20:27:30	sim642	finally got it right
2016-01-07 20:27:39	sim642	pressing meta-t triggers that
2016-01-07 20:27:57	sim642	${\01}[t being the equivalent of meta-t :P
2016-01-07 20:28:01	@nils_2	and i guess sim642 will add this trigger to the wiki :p
2016-01-07 20:28:12	sim642	now if you want this to be conditional then you'll need two triggers
2016-01-07 20:28:21	sim642	both having the same combo condition
2016-01-07 20:28:26	sim642	but some other different condition
2016-01-07 20:28:42	sim642	and thus they never run at the same time, and when either does it runs its own command
2016-01-07 20:29:04	@nils_2	well some solutions should be done with a script

2016-01-08 00:08:57	michalrus	Especially if it’s dropped (i.e. not properly ended in TCP sense).
2016-01-08 00:09:36	michalrus	FlashCode: probably it’s a question best answered by you. =)

2016-01-08 23:35:13	Zackio	is 1.4 a feature freeze?
2016-01-08 23:35:50	wlhlm	well, release candiate 2 got realeased yesterday, so I'd say yes.

2016-01-09 21:57:15	Pixelz	in addition of
2016-01-09 21:57:32	Pixelz	ansi codes are displayed by default by the terminal
2016-01-09 21:57:57	Pixelz	but as far as I can tell weechat strips out some of the control codes for them, so they don't get displayed

2016-01-09 21:58:50	Pixelz	well it does something
2016-01-09 21:59:30	sim642	\x1B is an unprintable character, no?
2016-01-09 21:59:37	sim642	that just shows up as ?
2016-01-09 21:59:51	sim642	and then it suddenly isn't an ANSI escape for the terminal
2016-01-09 21:59:56	Pixelz	that might be what it does then
2016-01-09 22:00:04	sim642	also, letting ansi escapes through directly would be bad
2016-01-09 22:00:22	sim642	ncurses wouldn't know anything about them and suddenly can't know what color it's drawing with etc
2016-01-09 22:00:47	sim642	/exec supports ansi escapes because it explicitly goes and parses them and turns that into weechat's internal colors
2016-01-09 22:00:51	sim642	so they'd show up right
2016-01-09 22:01:04	Pixelz	couldn't it do the same for things coming from IRC then?
2016-01-09 22:01:11	sim642	yes but why
2016-01-09 22:01:28	Pixelz	because people send those codes, and they don't display correctly
2016-01-09 22:01:45	sim642	tell those people about IRC colors
2016-01-09 22:02:08	Pixelz	it's not that simple, some of the ancient client doesn't support IRC colors
2016-01-09 22:02:12	Pixelz	and people are stuck in their ways
2016-01-09 22:02:12	sim642	because seriously, random people on the internet should have zero control over what my terminal displays
2016-01-09 22:02:21	sim642	if they do, things are already baaad
2016-01-09 22:02:35	sim642	Pixelz, but weechat isn't ancient
2016-01-09 22:02:54	sim642	also, if this is so desired thing, the parsing can be done in a script
2016-01-09 22:03:06	sim642	I see no reason whatsoever for this to be within weechat itself
2016-01-09 22:03:19	Pixelz	yea I've though of writing a script and maybe that's what I'll end up doing
2016-01-09 22:03:36	Pixelz	well, it's supported by every other terminal client that I know of since the dawn of time
2016-01-09 22:03:50	Pixelz	so it's not that big of a stretch to imagine that weechat would display them by default as well
2016-01-09 22:04:17	sim642	but see, passing ansi escape codes to terminal directly is dangerous
2016-01-09 22:04:21	Pixelz	but maybe other clients do some kind of filtering before it displays them, I'm not sure
2016-01-09 22:04:23	sim642	ansi escapes aren't just colors
2016-01-09 22:04:34	sim642	there's a whole billion other escapes that can be sent to mess up your terminal
2016-01-09 22:04:40	sim642	would you want malicious people doing that?
2016-01-09 22:04:43	sim642	I wouldn't
2016-01-09 22:04:55	sim642	if you do filtering, you do the parsing anyway
2016-01-09 22:05:03	sim642	so you can just as well convert them to weechat's own colors
2016-01-09 22:05:17	Pixelz	sounds like the best approach probably
2016-01-09 22:05:59	Pixelz	couldn't the filtering that exec does simply be applied to things coming from IRC as well?

2016-01-09 22:06:22	sim642	irc and exec are both plugins, complete independent and unaware of each other by design
2016-01-09 22:08:30	sim642	on a script level which sits separate of both, relying on both, their components could be used
2016-01-09 22:08:46	sim642	i.e. if the plugins expose that functionality to potential scripts using it
2016-01-09 22:09:22	sim642	there is an info for color_ansi_regex which gets the regex to match them
2016-01-09 22:09:33	sim642	not parse and convert though
2016-01-09 22:10:57	Pixelz	I meant if the code is there already in weechat, wouldn't it be a matter of using the same code somewhere else as well
2016-01-09 22:11:28	Pixelz	one of the replies in the issue said that it wouldn't be easy to add
2016-01-09 22:11:46	Pixelz	so I'm wondering if there's a deeper problem that I don't understand

2016-01-09 22:28:17	sim642	as much as I might disagree with the whole concept, if there's actual code already in weechat ready to do that, removing it would be harder than making use of it

2016-01-13 21:25:42	sim642	I still get the bug after nick change forth and back
2016-01-13 21:26:10	sim642	also it shows up differently broken in the weechat I am F1 myself

2016-01-14 23:43:57	Rasi	does new weechat open new queries automatically?
2016-01-14 23:44:01	myztic_unreg	so I did not get it to work, downloaded latest stable (1.4) and installed it all my locales point to en_US.UTF-8 and I followed the FAQ charset.default.decode is set to iso-8859-15 ; charset plugin is loaded ; weechat.look.eat_newline_glitch is off; charset.default.encode is UTF-8; weechat is linked to libncursesw; I do not use screen or tmux; and I use urxvt and it works in my terminal... I really don't know what to do
2016-01-14 23:44:02	Rasi	or did i press a key
2016-01-14 23:44:04	Rasi	:)
2016-01-14 23:44:50	myztic_unreg	and /charset now says charset: terminal: UTF-8, internal: UTF-8
2016-01-14 23:45:46	Rasi	ok, it definately auto-opens new query
2016-01-14 23:45:55	Rasi	hmm, whats the setting
