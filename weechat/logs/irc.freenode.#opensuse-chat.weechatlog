2015-11-04 20:14:47	cra1g321	then thought might as well install rtorrent on it
2015-11-04 20:17:26	cra1g321	there is a company very similar to digitalocean called vultr, i notice they offer you the optino to use your own images

2015-11-04 20:17:53	cra1g321	might be useful for someone wanting opensuse on a service like digitalocean,
2015-11-04 20:18:01	cra1g321	i've no experience with them though
2015-11-04 20:18:37	zutto	any idea what virtualization vultr uses cra1g321?

2015-11-04 20:18:56	cra1g321	95% sure
2015-11-04 20:19:09	zutto	wait, digitalocean switched away from hyperv?

2015-11-04 20:21:56	zutto	..or wait, could it be that my memory fails and it was hypervisor that they were talking about
2015-11-04 20:22:20	Psyq	zutto: okie hehehe it is okie :)
2015-11-04 20:24:39	zutto	vultr looks like it can compete with digitalocean, thats very nice

2015-11-07 21:18:43	tacit	I think cb400f you are mistaken.
2015-11-07 21:19:08	tacit	They care, they do stuff, and they are pretty good at it. It's just not for everyone, just like GNU/Linux isn't universal.

2015-11-07 22:05:01	Fuyou	I wonder if there is any better ideas than "magnifier glass" for "search" icon...
2015-11-07 22:05:25	Fuyou	It's not very intuitive and can be rather misleading
2015-11-07 22:06:11	cb400f	binoculars has been used sometimes
2015-11-07 22:06:24	cb400f	but about the same concept
2015-11-07 22:06:36	Fuyou	Yeah
2015-11-07 22:06:52	Fuyou	Maybe less likely to misinterpret as "zoom"
2015-11-07 22:07:18	Fuyou	(I need search icon for address search on map view)
2015-11-07 22:08:13	Fuyou	well, I can't think anything better than binoculars
2015-11-07 22:09:21	cb400f	magnifying glass seems to be the universal standard judging by my little sample test
2015-11-07 22:11:20	Fuyou	cb400f yes. But consider my case - what magnifier have to do with "start typying address and get hints from geocoder"
2015-11-07 22:11:42	Fuyou	Or webpage which has both search and image quick zoom
2015-11-07 22:12:05	cb400f	no idea :-) ... but osmand and Here Maps both use it anyway
2015-11-07 22:13:00	Fuyou	It's not critical, or a big deal at all, but I can't just accept this )
2015-11-07 22:15:35	cb400f	Apple spotlight uses a magnifying glass too, so it must be cool ;-)

2015-11-08 05:12:33	AlbertoP	dead
2015-11-08 05:12:46	cra1g321	yeah was thinking owncloud too , but with their file encryption, the key is stored on the server
2015-11-08 05:13:00	cra1g321	unless its changed
2015-11-08 05:13:35	CygniX	cra1g321: what do you mean the key is stored on the server?
2015-11-08 05:14:17	cra1g321	last time i looked at them, it said on their pages, that providers that offer file encrytion are still able to decrypt your files
2015-11-08 05:15:10	CygniX	how much were you willing to pay a month?
2015-11-08 05:15:18	cra1g321	Encryption and decryption always occurs on the server side. This enables you to continue to use all other apps to view and edit data. However, this method of encryption also means that the server administrator can intercept your data.
2015-11-08 05:15:19	Psyq	hey guys
2015-11-08 05:15:26	cra1g321	What this means is that you (your ownCloud server) keeps the key to decrypt your data.
2015-11-08 05:15:55	cra1g321	The goal of the Encryption app is to protect data on external storage.
2015-11-08 05:16:04	CygniX	cra1g321: run your own owncloud
2015-11-08 05:16:09	cra1g321	ah so its not even meant for data on the server
2015-11-08 05:16:23	CygniX	cra1g321: you can encrypt data on the current server
2015-11-08 05:16:29	CygniX	not just for external severs
2015-11-08 05:16:55	cra1g321	i'd rather not maintain a server though :/
2015-11-08 05:17:14	CygniX	set it up, forget about it
2015-11-08 05:17:17	cra1g321	though this debian droplet has been ticking along nicely
2015-11-08 05:17:26	CygniX	well, not true, one must do updates

2015-11-08 14:05:10	Fuyou	It seems I need MacOS to build for iOS. And just getting it to virtual machine has a few problems it seems
2015-11-08 14:06:58	ananke	because macosx by design is not meant to run in a vm, on a non-apple hardware.
2015-11-08 14:07:32	Fuyou	yes, that is the idea
2015-11-08 14:09:12	ananke	not to mention, that 'match your environment to your target OS/platform' is not something specific to macosx/apple. you'd be doing the same with windows, etc
2015-11-08 14:11:03	Fuyou	My app works just fine on linux and android already

2015-11-08 14:28:12	zutto	ios and whole apples app world is.. not fun
2015-11-08 14:28:22	zutto	and with 9/9.1, they broke everything
2015-11-08 14:28:48	zutto	they tell you to test your app on real devices
2015-11-08 14:29:01	zutto	and their acceptance process they run only their emulators that are buggy
2015-11-08 14:35:15	zutto	great thing about developing things for ios devices is that.. there isnt many devices, and the emulator workarounds are common amongst all emulator versions

2015-11-14 18:56:55	Tarminquay	I sent it to Kuhl, grayghost.
2015-11-14 18:57:03	Tarminquay	But with no RMA.

2015-11-14 18:59:40	Tarminquay	What do you think will happen?
2015-11-14 19:00:31	Tarminquay	The size on the garment didn't match the size on the sticker for the garment. And they sent me the size based on the mislabelled sticker.

2015-11-18 23:11:09	CygniX	AlbertoP: question
2015-11-18 23:11:20	tacit	Microsoft Office 2016 retains the floppy disk icon as the save symbol.
2015-11-18 23:12:40	CygniX	if you were to work on  a senior design project, and your partners presents you with an idea, you both will share the work load, but s/he retains the patent for it, would you accept?
2015-11-18 23:18:19	tacit	Depends on the compensation.
2015-11-18 23:18:35	CygniX	"good grade"
2015-11-18 23:19:04	tacit	Any equity on the table?
2015-11-18 23:19:11	CygniX	nope
2015-11-18 23:19:42	CygniX	it is a school senior design required for graduation for engineering students
2015-11-18 23:20:15	tacit	Then treat it as such. If you were looking for a good salaried position with none of your money in, it's yours. If you were looking to invest brain and work for a potential long-term benefit, it's not being offered.
2015-11-18 23:21:18	tacit	Ah senior as in college senior.
2015-11-18 23:21:21	CygniX	basically, he has an idea of the project that we'll work on for the senior design, while we'll both do equal work and get equal grade, but he wants to patent it, and he alone gets the patent
2015-11-18 23:22:23	AlbertoP	CygniX, uhmmmmmm

2015-11-24 19:35:05	AlbertoP	comments are nasty :|
2015-11-24 19:36:49	cb400f	just a couple of trolls going crazy, but yeah
2015-11-24 19:37:03	cb400f	guess they didn't realize that crowdfunding involves a risk
2015-11-24 19:37:28	AlbertoP	true
2015-11-24 19:37:46	AlbertoP	but I still don't think they have much hope...

2015-11-24 19:38:35	cb400f	hopefully... I think they might be getting close to some breakthrough with the tablet and the Intex phone
2015-11-24 19:38:51	cb400f	but they ran out of money when it was time to produce the tablets and capitalize :-(

2015-11-24 19:41:16	Phazeus_tux	psyq,   hello comrade! Steel released!! After half-year preparation :))
2015-11-24 19:41:21	AlbertoP	cb400f, how much was the tablet?
2015-11-24 19:41:38	AlbertoP	but well, losing 10MEuros of funding... not easy to replace
2015-11-24 19:42:02	cb400f	about 200 usd in the crowdfunding... would be usd 249,- in "retail" I think
2015-11-24 19:42:02	psyq	where were u last night hehehehe revealed and I missed u hahaha
2015-11-24 19:42:13	Phazeus_tux	hehe)
2015-11-24 19:42:21	cb400f	but the tablet was available for everywhere... not like the phone that was almost europe only
2015-11-24 19:42:49	revealed	psyq: 0o that was new to me... lol why would you have missed me?
2015-11-24 19:42:52	cb400f	also I think people have smaller requirements for tablets than for phones in terms of shitty, mainstream commercial apps
2015-11-24 19:43:18	AlbertoP	cb400f, I guess so too...
2015-11-24 19:43:50	Fuyou	There was a rumor about Yotaphone with SailfishOS, could be a tricky combo
2015-11-24 19:43:50	AlbertoP	but frankly, what would be the advantage of Sailfish compared to iOS, Android or Windows?
2015-11-24 19:44:36	AlbertoP	I mean, it's not fully open-source, you get less apps, it's likely less supported by carriers... I just don't see it working out easily

2015-11-24 19:45:42	AlbertoP	elsewhere it's probably easier, but again people want apps
2015-11-24 19:46:45	AlbertoP	it's the same problem with Windows Mobile... the OS is way more stable than Android, but it does not have apps... so it does not sell

2015-11-29 01:06:23	revealed	i bet there will be this moment when i ll be urged to boot the Win10 because i need it. And then this damn upgrade will start. And i will be pissed by MS update policy and frustrated.

2015-11-29 01:47:26	AlbertoP	and their coverage well...
2015-11-29 01:47:31	CygniX	you may have a point there
2015-11-29 01:47:35	AlbertoP	they make it up with wifi calling, but...
2015-11-29 01:47:59	AlbertoP	only works on their devices because they refuse to share the authentication and do not implement a standard
2015-11-29 01:48:43	AlbertoP	I guess you get what you pay for but they should stfu about "uncarrier" because they revealed to be worse than the rest in many aspects
2015-11-29 01:48:50	CygniX	they are a small carrier, so, they need something to make them unique and stand out

2015-11-29 01:52:43	AlbertoP	while they may be right when it comes to quality of the device, it's really nonsense for someone who wants to be "uncarrier"...
2015-11-29 01:52:52	AlbertoP	they carry 3-4 brands...
2015-11-29 01:53:24	AlbertoP	apparently even google nexus isn't on their list...

2015-11-29 01:58:11	AlbertoP	but t-mobile coverage is just useless
2015-11-29 01:58:32	AlbertoP	I stayed with them because abroad they work well and they are really cheap
2015-11-29 01:58:50	AlbertoP	and in the US with wifi calling they are OK
2015-11-29 01:59:29	AlbertoP	now, if I have to choose between the devices they have... and pay them what they want (more than unlocked!) to have that... the deal doesn't work anymore
2015-11-29 02:02:00	CygniX	just get an android device and be happy. :)

2015-11-29 02:08:17	AlbertoP	and their support was like "well reset it"
2015-11-29 02:08:21	CygniX	There are at least a dozen brands there on tmo site

2015-11-29 02:09:45	AlbertoP	it came down to samsung, lg, htc, apple, kyocera, and one more

2015-11-29 02:10:08	CygniX	ZTE
2015-11-29 02:10:17	AlbertoP	the majority is samsung... different versions of galaxy

2015-11-29 02:11:03	AlbertoP	in short they carry the top and bottom of the line... period
2015-11-29 02:11:16	AlbertoP	in the middle, zero, which is nonsense considering they are a cheapo carrier

2015-11-29 02:13:29	AlbertoP	just because they are bigger... in the end if nsa asks, they all say yes
2015-11-29 02:13:34	AlbertoP	it's obvious
2015-11-29 02:13:58	CygniX	in fact some providers refused to give up the booty hole that ATT willingly gave.
2015-11-29 02:14:13	AlbertoP	I suspect we just don't know
2015-11-29 02:14:52	AlbertoP	if you consider EU providers, they are all required to comply to requests of a judge, and it takes minutes to get one...

2015-11-30 20:53:32	cra1g321	ACER CB3-111 11.6" Chromebook - White £130
2015-11-30 20:54:28	cra1g321	perfect for that family member who uses a browser only :)
2015-11-30 20:55:14	zutto	or someone who wants to hack up cheap lunix machine
2015-11-30 20:56:20	cra1g321	meh if i had one i'd probably just keep chromeos on it
2015-11-30 20:56:56	cra1g321	or maybe go with debian + openbox
2015-11-30 20:57:31	zutto	i would go with same setup i have on all my own machines
2015-11-30 20:57:34	zutto	opensuse + dwm
2015-11-30 20:57:37	zutto	:P
2015-11-30 20:58:05	cra1g321	picking one up tomorrow, but wont be for me
2015-11-30 20:58:13	zutto	christmas present?
2015-11-30 20:58:21	cra1g321	yeah
2015-11-30 20:58:48	zutto	i got my dad lenovo tablet + chromecast + wifi repeater for christmas
2015-11-30 20:59:00	zutto	..and my mom got few months ago new lenovo lappy from me as early christmas present :P
2015-11-30 20:59:21	cra1g321	i'll probably get a new phone for christmas, maybe a moto g or Moto X
2015-11-30 20:59:42	zutto	i highly suggest looking at oneplus X
2015-11-30 21:01:06	zutto	the specs arent flagship-like anymore (oneplus 2 on the other hand is!) but the phone feels pretty amazing and for the ~260eur/usd its being sold is very amazing
2015-11-30 21:01:19	zutto	and its contagious :P

2015-11-30 21:02:59	cra1g321	yeah im not looking something amazing, something good within budget
2015-11-30 21:03:11	cra1g321	hence why my current phone is a 1st gen Moto G
2015-11-30 21:03:37	zutto	it'd be perfect for you then :P
2015-11-30 21:04:24	cra1g321	time to see how it compares to the Moto X Play

2015-11-30 21:05:20	AlbertoP_	still more choice
2015-11-30 21:05:51	cra1g321	im the rainy cold and depressing place that be the UK
2015-11-30 21:06:48	AlbertoP_	I finally decided to change carrier..
2015-11-30 21:07:04	cra1g321	thanks for the link zutto, they are very similar
2015-11-30 21:07:11	AlbertoP_	kind of tired of the nazi approach "iPhone or Samsung"
2015-11-30 21:07:21	zutto	i can list you the major dealbreakers:
2015-11-30 21:07:38	 *	AlbertoP_ thinks cra1g321 should take a peek also at the nexus 5x
2015-11-30 21:07:50	zutto	screen size (5.5 vs 5.0, it makes huge difference), NFC, and the camera
2015-11-30 21:07:54	zutto	thats about it
2015-11-30 21:08:27	cra1g321	i dont need nfc
2015-11-30 21:09:02	zutto	yuh
2015-11-30 21:09:14	cra1g321	nexus 5x is £100 or so more :/
2015-11-30 21:09:42	cra1g321	zutto, battery as well, moto X play, 3630 while one plus has 2525
2015-11-30 21:10:16	zutto	i dont think you'd notice the difference
2015-11-30 21:10:25	zutto	oneplus x is pretty battery optimized thing
2015-11-30 21:11:29	cra1g321	oneplus x looks better
2015-11-30 21:12:01	zutto	if you compare them on a table, everyone would pick oneplus x ofcourse
2015-11-30 21:12:06	zutto	its like iphone but cooler :P
2015-11-30 21:12:24	zutto	but the question is wether you can stand the 5.5" screen
2015-11-30 21:12:46	cra1g321	moto x is 5.5 , one plus x is 5.0
2015-11-30 21:12:51	zutto	yuh
2015-11-30 21:13:22	cra1g321	this moto g is 4.5
2015-11-30 21:13:42	zutto	was it only 4.5"?
2015-11-30 21:13:54	zutto	looks like it was, yeah
2015-11-30 21:13:58	cra1g321	yeah its a 1st gen one
2015-11-30 21:14:14	zutto	3rd gen was 5"
2015-11-30 21:14:37	zutto	4.5 to 5 is pretty ideal size
2015-11-30 21:15:45	zutto	its too bad oneplus is only making 10000 units of the ceramic version :/

2015-12-05 01:12:54	revealed	i read the FAQ and it is recommended there
2015-12-05 01:14:08	CygniX	OK
2015-12-05 01:15:18	CygniX	anyway, there was a time, encrypted /boot was not supported, unless it has been for a while and I wasnt aware, but latest opensuse does allow you to use /boot in an encrypted container
2015-12-05 01:16:44	CygniX	one of the down side of full encryption is that /boot always has to be encrypted, which means and adversary could inject code in the kernel (initrd) and comprise your security.
2015-12-05 01:16:58	CygniX	full disk encryption that is...
2015-12-05 01:17:27	CygniX	I meant, but always had to be unencrypted. :)

2015-12-05 01:18:34	CygniX	so, by having and grub_bios partition, you can now have /boot encrypted which creates another layer of security.
2015-12-05 01:19:15	CygniX	to get to the kernel, you have to first provide a luks phrase to decrypt the /boot partition.
2015-12-05 01:19:41	CygniX	know that the bootloader of course is still unencrypted of course.

2015-12-06 03:28:52	AlbertoP	you can see them in the account (and delete them)
2015-12-06 03:29:02	CygniX	I like Ronaldo, he is really cocky on the pitch, and that his style. but I just thought the pic was funny
2015-12-06 03:29:19	firebird	AlbertoP, soon, Google will have a "Here's what you sounded like in the year...." :P

2015-12-06 03:30:22	AlbertoP	CygniX, and Spain was one of the first EU countries to approve gay marriage, in spite of being very Catholic...
2015-12-06 03:30:32	AlbertoP	Italy well, lags way behind (as usual)
2015-12-06 03:30:41	AlbertoP	they can't even pass a law on civil unions
2015-12-06 03:31:00	CygniX	Well, while he plays in Spain, he is Portuguese
2015-12-06 03:32:39	AlbertoP	well it matters where you live ;)
2015-12-06 03:32:44	CygniX	considering the Pope is right next door, I think they may have something to do with italy lagging behind
2015-12-06 03:35:45	AlbertoP	CygniX, in part, but mostly a lot of political nonsense
2015-12-06 03:36:04	AlbertoP	CygniX, we still have politicians going around saying that being gay means being mentally hill..
2015-12-06 03:36:09	AlbertoP	ill*
2015-12-06 03:36:17	AlbertoP	meh I can't spell LOL
2015-12-06 03:36:57	CygniX	Isn't Italy a very religious nation?
2015-12-06 03:37:18	CygniX	and when it comes to equality for gays, it really boils down to religion.
2015-12-06 03:38:17	Jetchisel	the new pope is not too hardcore when it com3s
2015-12-06 03:38:34	Jetchisel	to 3rd sex it that helps
2015-12-06 03:38:38	Jetchisel	:)
2015-12-06 03:38:48	CygniX	tone is different but policy remains the same
2015-12-06 03:39:18	Jetchisel	i want some ice cream :)
2015-12-06 03:39:32	Jetchisel	brb
2015-12-06 03:40:36	AlbertoP	CygniX, it depends. Full of bigots... yes
2015-12-06 03:41:04	AlbertoP	CygniX, well a change in tone from him may make an ocean of difference.
2015-12-06 03:42:11	AlbertoP	Italy is under pressure from the EU to recognize rights to LGBT couples, in particular care, access to partner benefits and such, and some form of legal recognition of the union. Of course they will wait until the EU fines the country, and then... move fast and do a shitty law.
2015-12-06 03:42:12	AlbertoP	:P
2015-12-06 03:42:39	AlbertoP	they are using adoptions as excuse
2015-12-06 03:42:53	AlbertoP	claiming that if you say yes to marriage, you say yes to adoption too...
2015-12-06 03:43:12	CygniX	same adoption excuse was used here too. Think abou the children :)
2015-12-06 03:43:38	AlbertoP	as if it were better to live in a orphanage..
2015-12-06 03:43:47	AlbertoP	it's funny because singles can adopt...
2015-12-06 03:44:51	AlbertoP	CygniX, well in the US adoption was possible before marriage no? :-?
2015-12-06 03:45:02	CygniX	depends which sate
2015-12-06 03:45:05	CygniX	state
2015-12-06 03:45:17	AlbertoP	oh I see
2015-12-06 03:46:37	AlbertoP	I am sure IA does allow it because there is a famous person around here who did it...
2015-12-06 03:47:12	AlbertoP	which is quite surprising, considering how "conservative" people seem to be around here
2015-12-06 03:47:22	CygniX	IA was one of the first U.S. states to allow same sex marriage
2015-12-06 03:47:43	AlbertoP	yeah and they surprised many
2015-12-06 03:50:01	AlbertoP	but it definitely was in the air... my employer for example used to recognize benefits to lgbt couples way before the marriage was approved
2015-12-06 03:50:54	CygniX	personally stopped caring about the "issue" long long ago
2015-12-06 03:53:16	AlbertoP	well the "issue" is just not there...
2015-12-06 03:53:45	AlbertoP	but it is a good distraction to avoid talking of something else
2015-12-06 03:54:34	CygniX	well, in the u.s., after the court ruling, we can now focus on other distractions

2015-12-06 06:30:18	cra1g321	skype + whatsapp here
2015-12-06 06:30:25	AlbertoP	same
2015-12-06 06:30:36	AlbertoP	my nieces insist with WhatCrap
2015-12-06 06:30:37	AlbertoP	:P
2015-12-06 06:30:59	AlbertoP	would be so much easier with Skype >:)
2015-12-06 06:31:06	cra1g321	it's actually really good
2015-12-06 06:31:11	cra1g321	way better on my phone than skype
2015-12-06 06:31:20	cra1g321	skype crashed 2 times earlier on me
2015-12-06 06:31:34	AlbertoP	it's good for "SMS"
2015-12-06 06:31:41	AlbertoP	voice uhm didn't seem great
2015-12-06 06:31:54	Fuyou	We use it for messaging mostly
2015-12-06 06:32:00	AlbertoP	well skype on android ehm
2015-12-06 06:32:00	cra1g321	i think if does video calls, skype will have some decent competition
2015-12-06 06:32:13	AlbertoP	not in the US IMHO
2015-12-06 06:32:51	AlbertoP	WhatsApp is more popular in the EU, but ehm it's Facebook..
2015-12-06 06:33:55	cra1g321	for a app that has 900+ million users, there is very little ever posted about it
2015-12-06 06:34:27	AlbertoP	well nobody talks about phones or skype either :P
2015-12-06 06:34:47	cra1g321	i mean like on their website and blog
2015-12-06 06:35:04	AlbertoP	probably FB will kill it
2015-12-06 06:35:15	AlbertoP	they want people to use FB so they monetize
2015-12-06 06:35:30	cra1g321	currently its a $1 a year
2015-12-06 06:36:08	AlbertoP	that's not much for FB... if they move users to their FB chat...
2015-12-06 06:36:41	cra1g321	FB messanger is rather popular too
2015-12-06 06:36:50	Fuyou	Good question why there is paid chat client when so many others come up
2015-12-06 06:37:14	Fuyou	1$ is joke but I won't just because of bother paying
2015-12-06 06:37:29	cra1g321	can pay with google wallet or just with phone
2015-12-06 06:37:41	Fuyou	bother
2015-12-06 06:37:56	AlbertoP	it's 99 cents... and takes a click...
2015-12-06 06:38:01	cra1g321	$1 isnt a lot for a person, but if you have 900+ million users , its not a lot for whatsapp
2015-12-06 06:38:08	AlbertoP	I don't mind paying them if it's something I need
2015-12-06 06:38:14	cra1g321	its a lot for whatsapp *
2015-12-06 06:38:32	AlbertoP	for whatsapp as startup yes
2015-12-06 06:38:40	AlbertoP	for FB well... depends
2015-12-06 06:38:57	cra1g321	i seen ppl on reddit talking about in EU, literally entire countries use it
2015-12-06 06:39:23	AlbertoP	it is indeed very very popular in Italy
2015-12-06 06:39:42	Fuyou	Just a few years ICQ was a country-wide standard here...
2015-12-06 06:41:05	Fuyou	And when you told people almost noone use it elsewhere - people told it's because they don't have such cool clients as we do!
2015-12-06 06:42:25	AlbertoP	I didn't like ICQ
2015-12-06 06:42:27	cra1g321	a few friends in US have mentioned text free to me
2015-12-06 06:42:36	cra1g321	its so terrible compared to whatsapp
2015-12-06 06:42:47	cra1g321	i mention whatsapp and they have no clue what it is
2015-12-06 06:42:54	AlbertoP	I have three people using Whatsapp
2015-12-06 06:43:01	AlbertoP	the rest is all skype for me...
2015-12-06 06:43:08	Fuyou	Yeah, ICQ was bad in so many things
2015-12-06 06:43:08	AlbertoP	one uses hangouts... sigh...
2015-12-06 06:43:35	 *	AlbertoP finds hangouts clunky
2015-12-06 06:44:08	Fuyou	I always miss hangouts, it's something wrong with client's notifications
2015-12-06 06:44:24	cra1g321	i use it as sms app
2015-12-06 06:44:56	cra1g321	if im sending pics or got crap mobile reception but on wifi then its whatsaapp
2015-12-06 06:45:31	AlbertoP	I am less inclined to use multiple, so I pretty much tell others to contact me *ON SKYPE* :)
2015-12-06 06:45:41	AlbertoP	they have zero excuses... it works via web too
2015-12-06 06:46:54	cra1g321	yep that helps a lot with people who are considering a chromebook
2015-12-06 06:47:08	cra1g321	i've never used the web version
2015-12-06 06:48:23	AlbertoP	it's beta
2015-12-06 06:48:32	AlbertoP	and well I would never touch a chromebook
2015-12-06 06:48:53	 *	AlbertoP already regrets he got an android and it has been three days
2015-12-06 06:48:53	AlbertoP	LOL
2015-12-06 06:50:32	cra1g321	chromebooks meet a great requirement
2015-12-06 06:50:40	cra1g321	but i'd never have one either
2015-12-06 06:50:44	cra1g321	too much of a walled garden
2015-12-06 06:50:55	AlbertoP	can't really do much...
2015-12-06 06:51:02	AlbertoP	it's less than what you can do on a phone...
2015-12-06 06:51:43	Fuyou	Looks to me like if Google is going to become second Apple or MS
2015-12-06 06:51:56	AlbertoP	nah
2015-12-06 06:52:07	AlbertoP	before they do something that actually is good, they are dead
2015-12-06 06:52:15	AlbertoP	the only thing they did right is search
2015-12-06 06:52:25	AlbertoP	the rest well, a lot of hype
2015-12-06 06:52:27	Fuyou	Yeah, search is good
2015-12-06 06:52:45	Fuyou	using Bing, so have to admit
2015-12-06 06:52:52	AlbertoP	android happened to be the first open OS ...
2015-12-06 06:52:57	AlbertoP	I use bing too :)
2015-12-06 06:53:29	AlbertoP	which has become quite good too I have to say
2015-12-06 06:53:32	Fuyou	Actually I guess bing sucks a bit. Yandex beats it on soem fields
2015-12-06 06:54:09	AlbertoP	never used Yandex
2015-12-06 06:54:34	AlbertoP	but well my searches are quite standard
2015-12-06 06:54:50	Fuyou	well, it's CIS - oriented
2015-12-06 06:55:11	AlbertoP	anyway
2015-12-06 06:55:17	AlbertoP	my bed is calling me very hard :D
2015-12-06 06:55:21	AlbertoP	good night
2015-12-06 06:55:29	Fuyou	good night

2015-12-14 00:09:05	tzeemeesee	well, these priorities are the same, except KDE:Apps and KDE:Extra have now higher priority than oss

2015-12-14 00:10:11	tzeemeesee	revealed: that's a bigger task... KDE:Apps and KDE:Extra are not built against Frameworks5
2015-12-14 00:10:29	revealed	but 5.5 has many many bugfixes over 1000
2015-12-14 00:10:29	tzeemeesee	this would broke some KDE apps :P
2015-12-14 00:10:35	revealed	0o
2015-12-14 00:10:47	tzeemeesee	yep, but i would need to change KDE:Apps and KDE:Extra repos
2015-12-14 00:11:19	tzeemeesee	and KDE is fine and stable here, so i don't want to fiddle with that more :))
2015-12-14 00:11:51	revealed	why should that break extra and apps?
2015-12-14 00:11:58	revealed	i dont know of that
2015-12-14 00:12:11	revealed	its just some of these apps are not ported to plasma5 anyways at all
2015-12-14 00:12:18	revealed	or?
2015-12-14 00:12:49	revealed	and you can not run KDE4 on leap -- or did you manage to run KDE4 at the same time as Plasma5?
2015-12-14 00:13:53	revealed	do you get much stuff on this command? zypper pa --orphaned
2015-12-14 00:14:45	revealed	And on this? zypper pa --unneeded
2015-12-14 00:15:25	revealed	Also i have this scriptlet for you .... will take a while to run... it outputs missing files. You can then reinstall the named packages from output:
2015-12-14 00:15:28	revealed	rpm -qa | while read packagename ; do rpm -V $packagename | grep missing && echo $packagename ; done
2015-12-14 00:15:54	tzeemeesee	example: sorry, there is a change for elap, it's build against leap:update, not against Qt5... https://build.opensuse.org/project/meta/KDE:Frameworks5
2015-12-14 00:16:24	tzeemeesee	i didn't noticed this change... but in the past, Frameworks5 was build against Qt5, which has newer Qt than leap
2015-12-14 00:16:46	tzeemeesee	and that would broke i.e. apper, kde telepathy and possibly many others
2015-12-14 00:16:46	revealed	i dont understand this :)
2015-12-14 00:18:49	revealed	But in far future i see myselves on a point where i would again have to disable KF5 repo sadly and have to downgrade. Then stuck on a old version which does not supply a feature i need, having to upgrade whole OS then with broken fresh released KDE release
2015-12-14 00:19:07	revealed	moep
2015-12-14 00:20:07	tzeemeesee	revealed: BTW, tumbleweed has older KDE than KF?
2015-12-14 00:20:20	revealed	i think so, yes
2015-12-14 00:20:23	boombatower	depends on when, but at the moment it is a tad behind
2015-12-14 00:20:29	revealed	i use these repos on leap aswell on TW
2015-12-14 00:20:30	boombatower	probably get it this week
2015-12-14 00:20:31	boombatower	http://tumbleweed.boombatower.com/
2015-12-14 00:20:35	tzeemeesee	tumbleweed is Factory:snapshot, so it should have (almost) same version as KF
2015-12-14 00:20:36	boombatower	see Desktop section
2015-12-14 00:20:41	boombatower	for plasma related
2015-12-14 00:20:49	tzeemeesee	at least that is what i thought
2015-12-14 00:21:20	boombatower	yea the kde updates haven't hit factory yet
2015-12-14 00:21:56	tzeemeesee	well, the difference between KF and Tumbleweed is not so big for me to be worth of downloading
2015-12-14 00:22:11	boombatower	I would agree with that and will hit probably within a week
2015-12-14 00:22:30	tzeemeesee	i rather choose kernel:HEAD if i want to spend some bandwidth
2015-12-14 00:22:37	boombatower	:)

2015-12-19 17:53:03	unstableatom	So, same as .gr
2015-12-19 17:53:09	AlbertoP	interact with a public office and you will feel like the US are the perfect world
2015-12-19 17:53:16	unstableatom	hahaha
2015-12-19 17:53:42	unstableatom	So, it's just like larger-scale .gr
2015-12-19 17:54:26	--	You are now known as psyq_away
2015-12-19 17:55:33	unstableatom	AlbertoP, People in .gr say that things are waaaay better in .it, though
2015-12-19 17:55:41	unstableatom	Which may be true
2015-12-19 17:55:57	unstableatom	If I were to migrate, I wouldn't migrate there, though ;-P
2015-12-19 17:56:45	unstableatom	(No offense, but judging from your descriptions, it's not the ideal place to do such a thing in)
2015-12-19 17:57:43	unstableatom	BTW AlbertoP, is this publish-or-perish thing true?
2015-12-19 17:59:19	AlbertoP	unstableatom, Italy is probably a bit better than Greece
2015-12-19 17:59:38	AlbertoP	but the system is way behind many others in terms of serving the citizen
2015-12-19 17:59:44	unstableatom	I see
2015-12-19 18:00:08	AlbertoP	and frankly the problem is not in the laws only, but in people's brain
2015-12-19 18:00:16	unstableatom	Makes sense
2015-12-19 18:00:29	AlbertoP	there is so much sense of entitlement
2015-12-19 18:00:38	AlbertoP	you go to a public office...
2015-12-19 18:00:46	unstableatom	The laws are a mirror of the society's collective brain
2015-12-19 18:00:47	AlbertoP	wait for 15 minutes because... they drink coffee
2015-12-19 18:00:52	unstableatom	*consciousness
2015-12-19 18:00:54	unstableatom	AlbertoP, lol
2015-12-19 18:00:56	AlbertoP	then you ask...
2015-12-19 18:01:02	unstableatom	Sounds familiar
2015-12-19 18:01:08	AlbertoP	yes well those should be fired
2015-12-19 18:01:29	unstableatom	true true
2015-12-19 18:01:34	AlbertoP	a coffee it's fine, I don't think an office is a jail, but seriously, all together?
2015-12-19 18:01:46	unstableatom	heh
2015-12-19 18:02:04	unstableatom	I feel you
2015-12-19 18:02:06	unstableatom	:-(
2015-12-19 18:02:50	AlbertoP	people keep complaining about new "work laws"
2015-12-19 18:02:58	AlbertoP	but they are just common sense, really
2015-12-19 18:03:17	unstableatom	AlbertoP, BTW, I hear the US has passed a surveillance bill
2015-12-19 18:03:24	AlbertoP	uh?
2015-12-19 18:03:25	unstableatom	CISPA was the name?
2015-12-19 18:03:55	AlbertoP	not sure it passed
2015-12-19 18:03:58	AlbertoP	it was proposed
2015-12-19 18:03:59	unstableatom	It passed
2015-12-19 18:04:03	AlbertoP	today?
2015-12-19 18:04:06	unstableatom	mmmm
2015-12-19 18:04:21	unstableatom	As an omnibus law

2015-12-19 18:11:30	fermion	Who cares anyway? Private data must be stored in an airgapped network anyway
2015-12-19 18:11:36	AlbertoP	(and their anti-spam is a beast)
2015-12-19 18:11:39	fermion	So fuck that

2015-12-20 17:59:59	AlbertoP	cb400f, I got a lot of questions on Leap and the long support
2015-12-20 18:00:07	 *	AlbertoP needs to read sumfink about it ^_^
2015-12-20 18:00:17	--	You are now known as psyq
2015-12-20 18:00:28	cb400f	well... it's complicated :-)
2015-12-20 18:01:09	cb400f	supposedly, after 1 year there will be a service pack upgrading the kernel and the desktop software, but leaving most of the base system unchanged
2015-12-20 18:01:31	cb400f	and you have an additional 6 months to install this service pack
2015-12-20 18:01:57	cb400f	but there's no way of knowing in advance what parts get changed and what parts don't
2015-12-20 18:02:11	tacit	The current thinking is that all packages in leap that were inherited from SLE and that are touched in SLE 12 SP2, will be put into Leap.
2015-12-20 18:02:25	cb400f	so the maintainer might decide to upgrade php or whatever and break your server with the service pack
2015-12-20 18:02:40	cb400f	hmm
2015-12-20 18:03:09	tacit	cb400f: I am not sure this includes packages not inherited from SLE such as PHP.
2015-12-20 18:03:22	tacit	e.g. no breaking changes.
2015-12-20 18:03:40	cb400f	oh, php is already upgraded in 42.1?
2015-12-20 18:04:08	tacit	cb400f: From where to what?
2015-12-20 18:04:26	cb400f	wonder how much of sle12 is actually left in 42.1... and how much will be left in 42.2 and 42.3
2015-12-20 18:05:06	tacit	cb400f: Count. :-)   osc cat openSUSE:Leap:42.1:Update 00Meta lookup.yml
2015-12-20 18:10:24	 *	AlbertoP activates his CV-writing module and starts working on his CV o:-)
2015-12-20 18:15:29	cb400f	AlbertoP: ucph are going to lay off people in 2016... mostly phds and administration though, so you can still apply, even if we have "qualified stop of hiring"
2015-12-20 18:15:44	AlbertoP	budget cut
2015-12-20 18:15:45	AlbertoP	?
2015-12-20 18:16:15	cb400f	yup, right wing government got back in... cutting 2% every year for the next 4 years
2015-12-20 18:16:49	cb400f	also it's unclear how the service packs will be installed... but most likely by changing your repos and dup'ing
2015-12-20 18:17:29	cb400f	so the "long term support" will not be that different from the old model
2015-12-20 18:17:53	AlbertoP	cb400f, I am applying for a scholarship in France to be able to visit a colleague...
2015-12-20 18:18:04	AlbertoP	I kind of gave up looking for jobs in Europe
2015-12-20 18:18:14	cb400f	certainly not from desktop user perspective... and not so sure it'll be a smooth painless upgrade for servers for 3-4 years either
2015-12-20 18:18:30	cb400f	hmm
2015-12-20 18:18:50	AlbertoP	frankly, it would mean to have a worse quality of life than I have in the US, considering academic salaries in Europe, and the crankiness of the system
2015-12-20 18:19:32	AlbertoP	everything seems so much more complicated in the EU...
2015-12-20 18:20:06	AlbertoP	well, I should really say Europe, because non-EU countries in Europe aren't very different
2015-12-20 18:20:32	 *	cb400f sends AlbertoP to wash his mouth with soap
2015-12-20 18:20:49	AlbertoP	it's just how it is
2015-12-20 18:21:26	AlbertoP	less money, crazy bureaucracy, lot of personal friction usually
2015-12-20 18:22:03	AlbertoP	and well, all the advantages of being in Europe are going nuts (see services being cut to "pay the debt")
2015-12-20 18:23:44	cb400f	less so in Northern Europe I guess
2015-12-20 18:25:14	AlbertoP	example: in Italy I would retire at 67, with a not so attractive check because of the new contributive system and the fact I did not contribute since I worked abroad. In my US uni, you can technically retire at 54 (many do at 60 to have higher checks), still do something... and if you saved OK, + social security, it's not really bad
2015-12-20 18:26:11	AlbertoP	the positive side of being single is that I can choose ;)
2015-12-20 18:26:57	AlbertoP	cb400f, yeah I hope so...
2015-12-20 18:27:09	cb400f	hmm.. not even sure what my retirement age will be... they made some dynamic thing.. but prolly 69 or so :-|
2015-12-20 18:27:29	AlbertoP	cb400f, same in Italy...
2015-12-20 18:27:36	AlbertoP	in short you die before
2015-12-20 18:27:55	AlbertoP	and frankly I am not paying that shitload of taxes not to get it back...
2015-12-20 18:28:20	cb400f	71!!
2015-12-20 18:28:46	AlbertoP	at this point, for how it works in Italy, I would prefer a fully private solution where you can put the money and manage it as you like
2015-12-20 18:29:05	AlbertoP	cb400f, welcome to the German model! Work hard! :P
2015-12-20 18:29:15	cb400f	if you're born in 2015 it's a retirement age of 76 :-/
2015-12-20 18:29:24	AlbertoP	yeah well that's utter nonsense
2015-12-20 18:29:43	AlbertoP	whoever developed that either is incompetent, or wants slavery again
2015-12-20 18:30:01	cb400f	at the same time they're pushing people faster through education and earlier to the labour market
2015-12-20 18:30:16	AlbertoP	and again, I don't have any problem to drop the benefit if I do not have to pay for it
2015-12-20 18:30:27	AlbertoP	cb400f, of course
2015-12-20 18:30:38	AlbertoP	well prepared people tend to do something dangerous... they think
2015-12-20 18:31:17	AlbertoP	this is just the outcome of two decades of interpreting education as a mean to get a job
2015-12-20 18:31:36	AlbertoP	the consequence is that you learn very little and still can't get a job
2015-12-20 18:32:41	AlbertoP	interestingly EU politicians claim this is "the US system", but it's really not... the trend there is very different, and investments in scientific education are popping up everywhere
2015-12-20 18:33:00	AlbertoP	(also true that in the US, scientific education is behind the EU)
2015-12-20 18:33:15	AlbertoP	at least in high schools
2015-12-20 18:33:18	cb400f	hm, apparently the retirement age is adjusted every 5 years to expected lifetime.. so I can't know for sure what it'll be
2015-12-20 18:33:27	AlbertoP	yep
2015-12-20 18:33:40	AlbertoP	in Italy they are already planning to drop that system
2015-12-20 18:33:52	cb400f	guess global warming, wars, terrorism etc. will bring down the expected lifetime before too long
2015-12-20 18:34:25	AlbertoP	they are proposing something like 65 yo, but you can go at 62 with some penalty
2015-12-20 18:34:32	AlbertoP	which is way more acceptable
2015-12-20 18:34:50	cb400f	here they also pushed for years to have as many people going to uni as possible.. but in the last couple of years they've started wanting to admit fewer people
2015-12-20 18:35:07	AlbertoP	I would take the penalty very happily and keep doing something
2015-12-20 18:35:27	AlbertoP	cb400f, well that's more rational imho
2015-12-20 18:35:46	AlbertoP	or do we really think someone needs a degree to be a secretary at the city hall?
2015-12-20 18:35:56	cb400f	yup.. you still have something like 50% of academics being unemployed one year after graduating
2015-12-20 18:36:02	AlbertoP	keep high school qualified, and be done with that, really
2015-12-20 18:36:26	AlbertoP	hehe well I know that too well...
2015-12-20 18:36:36	AlbertoP	after all I moved 8k miles away LOL
2015-12-20 18:36:41	cb400f	:-)
2015-12-20 18:37:00	AlbertoP	and it wasn't exactly a choice at that time...
2015-12-20 18:37:25	AlbertoP	either enter the job market in Italy with a salary that didn't allow my rent to be paid, or go...
2015-12-20 18:37:57	AlbertoP	the choice wasn't particularly easy, but well...
2015-12-20 18:38:54	AlbertoP	my old uni asked me if I am interested in going back there... and uhm caused a lot of mixed feelings...
2015-12-20 18:38:55	AlbertoP	:P
2015-12-20 18:39:25	 *	AlbertoP replied "maybe when I am older" :)
2015-12-20 18:39:37	cb400f	:-)
2015-12-20 18:40:08	AlbertoP	also because being in academia lets me visit family often (and summer is off)
2015-12-20 18:40:10	 *	cb400f starts planning retirement somewhere between 2043 and 2047 when Europe prolly looks like a Mad Max movie
2015-12-20 18:40:34	AlbertoP	Europe is irritating
2015-12-20 18:40:47	AlbertoP	so much potential, so crappy execution
2015-12-20 18:41:52	AlbertoP	all fighting for their little tiny interests most of the time, and then talking about "the big picture" on TV
2015-12-20 18:43:06	cb400f	Donald Trump will probably invade Europe ;-)
2015-12-20 18:44:22	tacit	Any why would he do that?
2015-12-20 18:45:33	AlbertoP	cb400f, among the current R. candidates, he probably isn't the worse. This said, I am praying Geeko none of them wins.
2015-12-20 18:48:15	AlbertoP	cb400f, if polls don't lie, and Trump is the R. candidate, then well... we'll see the first woman president probably
2015-12-20 18:48:40	 *	AlbertoP hopes ants and bees will go to vote too... just to be safe
2015-12-20 18:48:54	tacit	candidate vs. party nominee
2015-12-20 18:50:00	AlbertoP	well if he wins the primary elections...
2015-12-20 18:50:14	AlbertoP	I still find it unlikely, but hey...
2015-12-20 18:50:15	tacit	Trump humm.. And just when you thought that Romney was the eventually unavoidable republican presidential nominee
2015-12-20 18:50:51	AlbertoP	well Romney wasn't THAT bad uh? :
2015-12-20 18:50:52	AlbertoP	:P
2015-12-20 18:52:14	AlbertoP	some think polls are not right and that Cruz and Bush will do better in the actual primary...
2015-12-20 18:56:17	AlbertoP	yesterday they had the Democratic debate...
2015-12-20 18:56:30	AlbertoP	seems easier on that side

2015-12-21 21:42:50	psyq	I haven't read it yet but if they meant what they was saying about not allowing the FBI a privat entity access to other data and information then it is good
2015-12-21 21:43:15	AlbertoP_	apparently it's more than that
2015-12-21 21:43:39	AlbertoP_	companies can't move data out of the EU without the owner consent
2015-12-21 21:43:49	AlbertoP_	which is easy if the owner is the third-party
2015-12-21 21:44:05	AlbertoP_	sorry, if the owner is the user
2015-12-21 21:44:16	AlbertoP_	but if the owner is a third party...ehm
2015-12-21 21:44:24	AlbertoP_	it becomes a mess of permissions
2015-12-21 21:44:25	AlbertoP_	LOL

2015-12-22 22:08:00	boombatower	only way the video drivers get better for gaming is when people put their wallet where their mouth is
2015-12-22 22:09:12	boombatower	at htis point 99% of the problems seem to be with ports of games not the drivers
2015-12-22 22:09:21	boombatower	look at _any_ valve game...they run better than on windows
2015-12-22 22:09:44	boombatower	when comparing draw calls and such it makes sense since valve games are usually an order of magnatude or more less calls
2015-12-22 22:09:49	boombatower	other ports are just _shit_
2015-12-22 22:10:09	boombatower	kinda like many of the console ports to windows
2015-12-22 22:10:33	boombatower	don't blame the os when there is a lazy programmer at fault

2015-12-22 22:13:07	revealed	man as you tell this i remember in a blogpost where one of that driver programmers complained over pages that they can not fix bugs for games properly as the devels of these games do not let them read their code
2015-12-22 22:13:23	revealed	But can not find it ...
2015-12-22 22:13:28	AlbertoP	nvidia is right not to open their stuff

2015-12-22 22:15:40	boombatower	valve was able to outperform windows on initial builds...I have no doubt once OSS drivers are fully caught up and they start optimizing we will see framerate increases over windows
2015-12-22 22:15:45	AlbertoP	it's just a major pain
2015-12-22 22:15:45	boombatower	then there will be a demand
2015-12-22 22:15:58	boombatower	again because of attitute and packaging

2015-12-22 22:17:02	boombatower	and others like trine
2015-12-22 22:17:24	boombatower	oss are quite good on radeon already

2015-12-22 22:22:38	boombatower	3-4 years ago a lot
2015-12-22 22:22:38	revealed	hm maybe i do this on weekend
2015-12-22 22:22:41	revealed	:D
2015-12-22 22:22:45	AlbertoP	firebird, o/
2015-12-22 22:22:50	AlbertoP	steamOS...
2015-12-22 22:22:58	boombatower	xbox os...
2015-12-22 22:23:00	boombatower	i can do that too
2015-12-22 22:23:51	boombatower	we are on the verge...and the next year will be either big fail or success
2015-12-22 22:26:25	AlbertoP	every year "it's the year of Linux"
2015-12-22 22:26:35	boombatower	I haven't been saying that, but yes I've heard it
2015-12-22 22:26:46	boombatower	they usually targetting consumers for dumb reasons
2015-12-22 22:27:09	boombatower	steammachines are like android phones and chromeos
2015-12-22 22:27:13	AlbertoP	right
2015-12-22 22:27:15	boombatower	ppl don't have to care or even know it's linux
2015-12-22 22:27:22	AlbertoP	and only android phones can be defined successful
2015-12-22 22:27:33	boombatower	chromebooks are certainly
2015-12-22 22:27:34	AlbertoP	the rest well, it's a nice experiment
2015-12-22 22:27:49	AlbertoP	that's a question of opinions
2015-12-22 22:28:02	AlbertoP	what can I do with a chromebook that I cannot do with a phone?
2015-12-22 22:28:11	AlbertoP	or a tablet?
2015-12-22 22:28:12	boombatower	not sure that's the point
2015-12-22 22:28:27	AlbertoP	yes it is the point a consumer will make...
2015-12-22 22:28:28	boombatower	it's a full keyboard + trackpad, better screen
2015-12-22 22:28:36	boombatower	plus non-neutered chrome
2015-12-22 22:28:40	AlbertoP	is it also heavier
2015-12-22 22:28:45	boombatower	laptops usually are
2015-12-22 22:28:51	AlbertoP	it's not a laptop
2015-12-22 22:28:59	AlbertoP	it's a client for a few services
2015-12-22 22:29:10	boombatower	the thing is although I people _can_ do more on windows/linux machine
2015-12-22 22:29:11	revealed	big plus and almost the only why i think of a bigger tablet d be streaming tv
2015-12-22 22:29:13	boombatower	99% of ppl don't
2015-12-22 22:29:17	boombatower	which is why they like phones
2015-12-22 22:29:23	AlbertoP	in spite of dreams, many don't work that way
2015-12-22 22:29:29	boombatower	you and I sure, but we're always the people that will have desktops 10 years from now
2015-12-22 22:29:34	boombatower	even though they keep sayingthey're dead
2015-12-22 22:29:42	AlbertoP	say, how do I use a smartcard on that thing to access a public service?
2015-12-22 22:30:01	AlbertoP	oh I won't mention any "developer" counter example
2015-12-22 22:30:06	AlbertoP	just practical stuff
2015-12-22 22:30:06	boombatower	that's comparing two totally different things
2015-12-22 22:30:10	AlbertoP	oh no
2015-12-22 22:30:10	revealed	lol put finger in ;)
2015-12-22 22:30:11	AlbertoP	it's not
2015-12-22 22:30:12	boombatower	I don't buy a laptop/chromebook to use as a  phone
2015-12-22 22:30:29	AlbertoP	chromebooks aim at those consumers who "don't need a full laptop"
2015-12-22 22:30:33	boombatower	if I wanted a phone i'd buy one
2015-12-22 22:30:40	boombatower	which is 99% of people
2015-12-22 22:30:46	AlbertoP	now, that statement is incorrect
2015-12-22 22:30:47	boombatower	even if the consumer doesn't know it
2015-12-22 22:30:48	AlbertoP	and deeply
2015-12-22 22:31:02	boombatower	you watch people? all they do on phone is web stuff
2015-12-22 22:31:07	boombatower	either in an app or web page
2015-12-22 22:31:09	boombatower	and texting
2015-12-22 22:31:10	boombatower	same on laptop
2015-12-22 22:31:12	AlbertoP	for example, in the EU many need a smartcard or some special authentication token to access their public services...
2015-12-22 22:31:19	AlbertoP	how do you do that on a chromebook?
2015-12-22 22:31:36	boombatower	no familiar with that as doesn't sound like something we have in US
2015-12-22 22:31:40	boombatower	so different environment
2015-12-22 22:31:51	boombatower	but also doesn't sound unacheiveable if google wanted to add it
2015-12-22 22:32:01	revealed	Alberto some android phones have USB connector which can work with e.g. keyboard. Same should work for a card reader then i think
2015-12-22 22:32:11	AlbertoP	well the US have similar situations but more rarely (due to technology not being implemented)
2015-12-22 22:32:28	AlbertoP	revealed, and the software? ;)
2015-12-22 22:32:31	boombatower	revealed: yea you can use usb cameras and shit too
2015-12-22 22:32:31	AlbertoP	sigh
2015-12-22 22:32:32	boombatower	built in
2015-12-22 22:32:40	AlbertoP	you are simplifying a problem too much, sorry
2015-12-22 22:32:46	AlbertoP	no, the software to access services
2015-12-22 22:32:49	boombatower	my main point wasn't chromebooks, but yea
2015-12-22 22:32:49	revealed	depends on the smartcard devices and services. If those are available you would get it
2015-12-22 22:33:13	boombatower	definitely seems like if there was demand the smart card would work
2015-12-22 22:33:24	revealed	If you would intend to create such solution you would supply hardware and software
2015-12-22 22:33:28	AlbertoP	linux has its role, but to be honest, in the consumer market it is quite a mess for linux
2015-12-22 22:33:46	boombatower	sure, but not because it needs to be
2015-12-22 22:33:47	AlbertoP	it's just being a bit practical...
2015-12-22 22:34:00	AlbertoP	it's intrinsic in the idea of FOSS
2015-12-22 22:34:14	boombatower	problem is how can the world move forward on windows with admitted backdoors and spying...seriously
2015-12-22 22:34:18	boombatower	that's how we move into the future
2015-12-22 22:34:39	AlbertoP	it's an advantage for a lot of things, but if you need to sell a device that works, you end up doing what Google did... in practice, close it...
2015-12-22 22:34:42	boombatower	that's alos intrinsic to foss
2015-12-22 22:34:56	AlbertoP	boombatower, there is *no* evidence of those backdoors
2015-12-22 22:34:57	revealed	But also with android theres loads of bloat and spy
2015-12-22 22:35:08	boombatower	AlbertoP: says several eu governemtn papers
2015-12-22 22:35:08	AlbertoP	that's complete bullshit that disqualifies your point
2015-12-22 22:35:09	boombatower	ok
2015-12-22 22:35:13	boombatower	and M$ tos
2015-12-22 22:35:20	boombatower	and network traffic monitoring on win 10
2015-12-22 22:35:31	boombatower	there's mre evidence than can be easily brushed aside
2015-12-22 22:35:53	AlbertoP	boombatower, the EU governments *do* use Windows
2015-12-22 22:36:05	boombatower	hence why they studied it and released papers
2015-12-22 22:36:09	AlbertoP	so, either they are stupid, or clearly they don't have a problem
2015-12-22 22:36:10	boombatower	and several like russia moved away
2015-12-22 22:36:21	boombatower	i keep reaidng about eu government considering alternatives
2015-12-22 22:36:24	boombatower	for that reason
2015-12-22 22:36:28	boombatower	and I don't blame them
2015-12-22 22:36:33	AlbertoP	boombatower, I read that too, but it does not work LOL
2015-12-22 22:36:35	boombatower	russia has their own linux distro
2015-12-22 22:36:41	cra1g321	govement ppl here are starting to use chromebooks rather than windows laptops
2015-12-22 22:36:43	revealed	i can confirm there are projects trying to use linux
2015-12-22 22:36:45	boombatower	it does if you make it work
2015-12-22 22:36:54	AlbertoP	because in Russia nobody in the government uses Windows?
2015-12-22 22:37:08	boombatower	keep using extremes..."nobody"
2015-12-22 22:37:22	AlbertoP	trying to does not mean succeeding....I have read of many experiments, but costs were way higher and results worse...
2015-12-22 22:37:24	boombatower	like saying nobody in us governemt uses linux
2015-12-22 22:37:30	boombatower	many success stories too
2015-12-22 22:38:02	AlbertoP	I know Munich and a few others. Which at least equal the number of reverse conversions from Lin to Win...
2015-12-22 22:38:12	boombatower	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_adopters
2015-12-22 22:38:21	revealed	That was 2003 or so?
2015-12-22 22:38:30	AlbertoP	cra1g321, so they use Google instead of MS, and store everything in the Google cloud? :)
2015-12-22 22:38:39	boombatower	and that's just a few
2015-12-22 22:38:40	AlbertoP	has to be critical info!
2015-12-22 22:39:08	cra1g321	they use some version of libreoffice made especially for government and stuff
2015-12-22 22:39:09	AlbertoP	boombatower, adopters does not mean they use it for everything... let's not try to fool each other
2015-12-22 22:39:17	boombatower	read the details
2015-12-22 22:39:19	cra1g321	but again this is early adoption for now
2015-12-22 22:39:23	boombatower	also not like they use windows for everything ever
2015-12-22 22:39:25	boombatower	...
2015-12-22 22:39:28	boombatower	extremes don't show anything
2015-12-22 22:39:44	revealed	I think this is it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiMux
2015-12-22 22:39:53	AlbertoP	boombatower, the fact they are evaluating one solution says little about its penetration, really
2015-12-22 22:39:56	AlbertoP	and the problem is...
2015-12-22 22:40:06	AlbertoP	those governments must interface with the public
2015-12-22 22:40:14	boombatower	half of those cases talk about how many are using actively and on how many machines...
2015-12-22 22:40:16	cra1g321	i think there is a fair amount of false reporting on that munich switches to linux story
2015-12-22 22:40:17	AlbertoP	and the public does not use ODF, LibreOffice, or Linux...
2015-12-22 22:40:24	boombatower	who the hell sends word docs in emails
2015-12-22 22:40:27	boombatower	that's insain
2015-12-22 22:40:27	AlbertoP	they use Windows and Mac (with office)
2015-12-22 22:40:30	boombatower	for many many reasons
2015-12-22 22:40:44	boombatower	pdf/html
2015-12-22 22:40:45	AlbertoP	3%... that's it
2015-12-22 22:40:52	AlbertoP	boombatower, right you edit that LOL
2015-12-22 22:40:52	boombatower	not like people read word docs on phones by in large
2015-12-22 22:41:12	boombatower	most eu governemnt shave used open office longer than linux
2015-12-22 22:41:18	AlbertoP	boombatower, according to the number of downloads of Word for Android, I beg to differ
2015-12-22 22:41:18	boombatower	not most, but a number
2015-12-22 22:41:30	AlbertoP	one of most downloaded app?
2015-12-22 22:41:43	boombatower	again, you give people a pdf, odf and loads on android automatically
2015-12-22 22:41:44	boombatower	i see no issue
2015-12-22 22:41:46	boombatower	it's a choice
2015-12-22 22:42:05	AlbertoP	boombatower, I see the issue if I have to create it
2015-12-22 22:42:17	AlbertoP	especially if I have to make a presentation in LO...
2015-12-22 22:42:22	AlbertoP	it takes way longer
2015-12-22 22:42:30	boombatower	on what basis?
2015-12-22 22:42:33	boombatower	do it all the time
2015-12-22 22:42:42	AlbertoP	that is not the point
2015-12-22 22:42:43	boombatower	they are nearly identical
2015-12-22 22:42:48	boombatower	same reason google docs was so popular
2015-12-22 22:42:51	AlbertoP	the point is productivity
2015-12-22 22:42:53	boombatower	ppl dont use 99% of features in word
2015-12-22 22:42:53	AlbertoP	LOL
2015-12-22 22:42:57	AlbertoP	"nearly identical"
2015-12-22 22:42:59	boombatower	you only use 4
2015-12-22 22:43:02	AlbertoP	ok...
2015-12-22 22:43:07	boombatower	for what people use they are
2015-12-22 22:43:08	AlbertoP	usual arguments
2015-12-22 22:43:13	boombatower	because they're accurate
2015-12-22 22:43:18	AlbertoP	no they are not
2015-12-22 22:43:26	boombatower	you telling me the masses in govertment do fancy stuff in word?
2015-12-22 22:43:27	 *	cra1g321 wonders what the original discussion was about
2015-12-22 22:43:28	AlbertoP	try to give anybody Office and LO...
2015-12-22 22:43:32	boombatower	nope they have a hard time setting margins
2015-12-22 22:43:40	AlbertoP	they will pick Office for the ease of use
2015-12-22 22:43:41	boombatower	cra1g321: radeontop
2015-12-22 22:43:51	boombatower	AlbertoP: they pick it because they learned it in school
2015-12-22 22:43:54	boombatower	and odn't know what else there is
2015-12-22 22:43:56	AlbertoP	boombatower, really?
2015-12-22 22:43:59	boombatower	yes
2015-12-22 22:44:04	cra1g321	yeah i agree
2015-12-22 22:44:07	revealed	yes school is almost a tryed bad ms cert
2015-12-22 22:44:10	boombatower	any of people I know have no issue using libreoffice
2015-12-22 22:44:16	cra1g321	they pick it because they know it, not because of its ease of use
2015-12-22 22:44:21	revealed	if you find a teacher teaching about linux you are lucky
2015-12-22 22:44:27	boombatower	familiarity is 99.99999999% of it
2015-12-22 22:44:31	AlbertoP	actually, many cases of conversion to Linux failed, even after specific training because the time required to work with LO and other tools was significantly higher
2015-12-22 22:44:33	boombatower	that's why m$ gives schools free copies
2015-12-22 22:44:44	boombatower	AlbertoP: again, we created that problem
2015-12-22 22:44:45	AlbertoP	one of the reason were formats, but there is a lack of features that is a problem
2015-12-22 22:44:48	boombatower	not a LO problem
2015-12-22 22:44:51	boombatower	is a conversation problem
2015-12-22 22:44:55	AlbertoP	no, it's a usability problem
2015-12-22 22:45:02	AlbertoP	I used LO for about 4-5 years
2015-12-22 22:45:04	boombatower	LO looks like word 6 years ago
2015-12-22 22:45:06	AlbertoP	I knew all the tricks
2015-12-22 22:45:06	boombatower	and people used it then
2015-12-22 22:45:10	boombatower	...
2015-12-22 22:45:22	revealed	basically if you can work with word you can also with LO
2015-12-22 22:45:27	revealed	and vice versa
2015-12-22 22:45:35	AlbertoP	well, sorry, Office is faster, produces better quality slides, and the GUI is much much more friendly
2015-12-22 22:45:38	boombatower	people serious use page margins, bold, italics, and underline, and sometimes tables and iamges...thats' it
2015-12-22 22:45:41	boombatower	that's all peopleuse word for
2015-12-22 22:45:47	AlbertoP	the point is not *can*, is *want to*
2015-12-22 22:45:56	boombatower	i'll give you that
2015-12-22 22:46:01	AlbertoP	do I want to work with something that makes my life a bit harder, or a bit easier?
2015-12-22 22:46:01	boombatower	but that is again our making
2015-12-22 22:46:06	boombatower	we let M$ buy our schools
2015-12-22 22:46:11	boombatower	and indotrinate kids
2015-12-22 22:46:13	AlbertoP	lol
2015-12-22 22:46:17	revealed	:D
2015-12-22 22:46:22	boombatower	teach em LO and they'll wonder what Word is
2015-12-22 22:46:27	AlbertoP	cospiracy theories now?
2015-12-22 22:46:29	boombatower	teach em both...oh knows
2015-12-22 22:46:32	boombatower	AlbertoP: how so
2015-12-22 22:46:36	boombatower	they give out free copies
2015-12-22 22:46:38	boombatower	that donation
2015-12-22 22:46:39	AlbertoP	because this was attempted...
2015-12-22 22:46:43	AlbertoP	and it didn't work
2015-12-22 22:46:44	boombatower	that same sas buying
2015-12-22 22:46:50	boombatower	"didn't work"
2015-12-22 22:46:56	boombatower	means they tried on on peeople that already knew word
2015-12-22 22:46:59	boombatower	and they complained for 1 day
2015-12-22 22:47:01	boombatower	so they changed back
2015-12-22 22:47:17	AlbertoP	yeah it didn't... because in the end those students will need to know Office, on one hand, and on the other hand, LO fails at delivering...
2015-12-22 22:47:17	revealed	Question how long would you think would it take to guide 20 ppl to once have used every function LO provides compared to MSo
2015-12-22 22:47:19	AlbertoP	for example
2015-12-22 22:47:27	AlbertoP	one claim is "Word loses formatting"
2015-12-22 22:47:37	AlbertoP	well Writer does exactly the same, constantly
2015-12-22 22:47:38	boombatower	AlbertoP: you realize most ppl don't even know how to copy paste without rigth clicking
2015-12-22 22:47:42	AlbertoP	so what's the point?
2015-12-22 22:47:45	boombatower	to tell me they know jack shit about office is nuts
2015-12-22 22:47:50	boombatower	they need to "relearn" 4 things
2015-12-22 22:47:54	AlbertoP	boombatower, that's not the point. They are the same people
2015-12-22 22:48:12	AlbertoP	if they work better in front of one tool, rather than another one, the comparison is fair...
2015-12-22 22:48:25	boombatower	they only work better because they've always been taught it
2015-12-22 22:48:44	boombatower	so if we were all on drugs since birth and "worked better" we should not get off them?
2015-12-22 22:48:44	AlbertoP	seriously, we are not talking about rocket science
2015-12-22 22:48:49	boombatower	that's not a reason to continue doing something
2015-12-22 22:48:51	AlbertoP	we are talking about editing the theme of a slide...
2015-12-22 22:48:56	boombatower	agree
2015-12-22 22:48:58	AlbertoP	one click in PPT
2015-12-22 22:49:00	boombatower	which is why LO is more than sufficient
2015-12-22 22:49:07	AlbertoP	several in LO
2015-12-22 22:49:10	boombatower	have you used it?
2015-12-22 22:49:12	AlbertoP	that's what I am saying
2015-12-22 22:49:15	boombatower	making me wonder
2015-12-22 22:49:16	AlbertoP	yes I have... I told you
2015-12-22 22:49:28	boombatower	not sure we used the same software
2015-12-22 22:49:32	AlbertoP	I used LO to prepare my stuff for years, and frankly I gave up
2015-12-22 22:50:01	boombatower	AlbertoP: I load either LO and click presenation and insantly on title slide
2015-12-22 22:50:01	AlbertoP	the switch to the new GUI helped a lot in the decision... it's a disaster
2015-12-22 22:50:07	boombatower	or i load impress staight away
2015-12-22 22:50:09	boombatower	1 click
2015-12-22 22:50:10	AlbertoP	boombatower, the *theme*
2015-12-22 22:50:10	boombatower	wtf
2015-12-22 22:50:12	boombatower	easy peasy
2015-12-22 22:50:13	AlbertoP	not the titlte
2015-12-22 22:50:15	AlbertoP	title
2015-12-22 22:50:32	AlbertoP	evidently, never tried to do that
2015-12-22 22:50:38	boombatower	I think we live on different planets
2015-12-22 22:50:41	AlbertoP	if you need to edit the master slides in LO, good luck
2015-12-22 22:50:42	boombatower	all I can conclude
2015-12-22 22:50:54	AlbertoP	yeah, you know, someone has professional needs ;)
2015-12-22 22:51:19	boombatower	view -> master slide
2015-12-22 22:51:21	boombatower	done

2015-12-22 22:52:06	AlbertoP	I have Impress in front of me :P
2015-12-22 22:52:35	boombatower	every slide I insert now has changes
2015-12-22 22:52:37	boombatower	works just fine
2015-12-22 22:52:57	boombatower	can also do same thing in gdocs
2015-12-22 22:52:59	boombatower	...
2015-12-22 22:53:03	boombatower	no one needs office
2015-12-22 22:53:06	AlbertoP	create two masters :)
2015-12-22 22:53:21	AlbertoP	what ppt calls "layout"
2015-12-22 22:53:33	AlbertoP	which well... are by chance made for you in ppt :P
2015-12-22 22:53:59	AlbertoP	boombatower, point is...
2015-12-22 22:54:11	AlbertoP	you can do stuff in LO/Linux/whatever...
2015-12-22 22:54:24	AlbertoP	but how much energy does it take?
2015-12-22 22:54:37	boombatower	same as on word
2015-12-22 22:54:40	boombatower	you just know it already
2015-12-22 22:54:49	boombatower	like learning new car
2015-12-22 22:54:50	boombatower	new bike
2015-12-22 22:54:52	boombatower	new anything
2015-12-22 22:54:53	AlbertoP	if you do that daily, you want something streamlined, and LO, Docs, whatever, are not as easy as Office.
2015-12-22 22:55:05	AlbertoP	I mean, seriously, who would pay if it were!
2015-12-22 22:55:12	boombatower	most milenials are using gdocs now which is interesting
2015-12-22 22:55:19	boombatower	ppl are really dumb
2015-12-22 22:55:24	boombatower	they don't even know anything else exists
2015-12-22 22:55:31	boombatower	why do yo uthink M$ got away with calling 360 new
2015-12-22 22:55:33	AlbertoP	no no trust me, I teach in a university, and NOBODY used gdocs for anything serious
2015-12-22 22:55:36	boombatower	when gdocs did more for 5 years
2015-12-22 22:55:38	AlbertoP	they use it to share stuff
2015-12-22 22:55:42	boombatower	people didn't even know gdocs exists
2015-12-22 22:55:44	AlbertoP	which they edit... in Word
2015-12-22 22:56:02	AlbertoP	so yeah, sure, they use gdocs, word online, whatever... buuuuuut
2015-12-22 22:56:03	boombatower	university means nothing
2015-12-22 22:56:07	boombatower	it's same as everywhere else

2015-12-22 22:57:15	boombatower	and new slide that used it
2015-12-22 22:57:16	AlbertoP	not always right, but just check the PDFs you get... tons of "Created with MS word bla bla" or "Adobe plugin for word"
2015-12-22 22:57:16	boombatower	done

2015-12-22 22:57:31	microchip_	grrr
2015-12-22 22:57:54	AlbertoP	boombatower, the problem is that you had to do it. A PPT user does not need to do that, because he has it already in the ribbon...
2015-12-22 22:57:54	boombatower	create new master slide the same way you make other slides in master view
2015-12-22 22:57:59	boombatower	then you can apply to w/e slides you want
2015-12-22 22:58:04	AlbertoP	literally... 1 click

2015-12-23 00:17:20	AlbertoP	I doubt the future is made by nvidia to be a bit realistic, considering the world we live in...
2015-12-23 00:17:29	boombatower	it's made by hundreds of thousands of small choices
2015-12-23 00:17:33	boombatower	nvidia/amd is one of them
2015-12-23 00:17:42	boombatower	and the behavior it encourages across the board
2015-12-23 00:17:47	boombatower	well if I cheat I can suceed
2015-12-23 00:17:52	boombatower	wonder if I can do ti ton taxes too

2015-12-23 00:18:28	boombatower	so the ends justify the means?

2015-12-23 00:19:43	AlbertoP	I pick what I think is the best product for my money...
2015-12-23 00:19:54	boombatower	again ends justify means
2015-12-23 00:20:00	boombatower	scary places that got us in history
2015-12-23 00:20:01	AlbertoP	boombatower, food is a BIT more relevant, don't you think?
2015-12-23 00:20:19	boombatower	how we get places or more relevant than where we end up, don't you think?
2015-12-23 00:20:25	AlbertoP	you just claim we must be consistent in all our choices... it's not reality
2015-12-23 00:21:17	boombatower	and so we see why the world is run by assholes
2015-12-23 00:21:46	boombatower	if everyone gave a shit outside their little sphere once in a while
2015-12-23 00:21:48	AlbertoP	excluding that I didn't know of the claim against nvidia until you showed the video to me, I still will buy their products if they work better. Again, it's a video card, nothing related to the future of kids, health, life, survival...
2015-12-23 00:22:13	AlbertoP	you are trying to generalize, which isn't the case
2015-12-23 00:22:17	boombatower	but then we define sucess by being unethical
2015-12-23 00:22:26	boombatower	which is true for most industries right now
2015-12-23 00:22:27	AlbertoP	legally unethical
2015-12-23 00:22:30	boombatower	you don't win by making the better thing

2015-12-23 00:22:49	AlbertoP	they do not have to be fair with AMD and share technology...
2015-12-23 00:22:50	boombatower	you win by being the biggest dick you can be without anyone calling you on it
2015-12-23 00:22:58	boombatower	not a matter of sharing
2015-12-23 00:23:10	AlbertoP	well in the end it is...
2015-12-23 00:23:17	AlbertoP	and they do not have to
2015-12-23 00:23:53	boombatower	AlbertoP: the biggest claims against nvidia are paying game devs to turn things on that kill performance across the board for 0 visual benefit (litterally objects under the ground and shit)
2015-12-23 00:23:58	boombatower	and force people to buy better cards
2015-12-23 00:24:05	boombatower	and tweaked to hurt amd worse
2015-12-23 00:24:10	boombatower	sharing is not the main topic
2015-12-23 00:24:34	AlbertoP	boombatower, again, sorry to poke the pink bubble, it's business as usual for those companies...
2015-12-23 00:24:36	boombatower	that isn't even producing something better
2015-12-23 00:24:47	boombatower	because we buy there shit
2015-12-23 00:24:55	boombatower	they don't exist without us
2015-12-23 00:25:38	AlbertoP	I don't attribute an ethical value to it simply because of what they make. AMD is big enough to fight.
2015-12-23 00:25:53	AlbertoP	if they think there was unfair competition, they can bring nvidia to court
2015-12-23 00:25:54	boombatower	then we give up a role
2015-12-23 00:26:09	boombatower	courts are supposed to be last resourt
2015-12-23 00:26:16	boombatower	not only and first solution like we treat them
2015-12-23 00:26:18	AlbertoP	a role we do not have cannot be given up :)
2015-12-23 00:26:28	boombatower	like kids going to parents to resolve issue on playground
2015-12-23 00:26:31	boombatower	grow the fuck up
2015-12-23 00:26:45	boombatower	AlbertoP: we make them exist by buying things
2015-12-23 00:26:48	boombatower	that's a choice
2015-12-23 00:26:48	AlbertoP	I am not going to buy a worse product for the same price I could get a better one, if we are discussing about this...
2015-12-23 00:26:50	boombatower	that's our role
2015-12-23 00:27:03	boombatower	worse because they portray it that way
2015-12-23 00:27:05	boombatower	not because it is
2015-12-23 00:27:13	AlbertoP	ehm
2015-12-23 00:27:21	boombatower	you apparently ignored everything i've said
2015-12-23 00:27:24	boombatower	not looping again
2015-12-23 00:27:29	AlbertoP	I am very likely a bit more grown up than you :P
2015-12-23 00:27:33	AlbertoP	unfortunately
2015-12-23 00:27:35	boombatower	not talking to you
2015-12-23 00:27:39	boombatower	part of the analogy
2015-12-23 00:27:46	AlbertoP	I have not started this..
2015-12-23 00:27:47	howi	"screw you guys im going home"
2015-12-23 00:28:05	boombatower	didn't say you did
2015-12-23 00:28:06	boombatower	did i?
2015-12-23 00:28:08	AlbertoP	frankly I wasn't interested in arguing about nvidia and amd
2015-12-23 00:29:08	boombatower	oh well, I was just depressed by your outlook on we are to just absorb what we are told with no choice and no impact
2015-12-23 00:29:11	boombatower	not sure why I came back for more

2015-12-23 00:29:20	AlbertoP	AMD should move their butt and make better CPU's to compete with Intel IMHO, but they fell so far behind it's sad...
2015-12-23 00:29:37	AlbertoP	boombatower, well I doubt that label can be attached to me LOL
2015-12-23 00:29:57	AlbertoP	I am definitely hypercritical on many many things
2015-12-23 00:30:20	AlbertoP	except that I want stuff to work when it comes to technology
2015-12-23 00:30:37	AlbertoP	and I get itchy when sucky stuff is explained with "ethics"
2015-12-23 00:31:29	boombatower	a) unless you have some specific example I've used both and read both extensively....they both work fine, b) just think how much better they both might work if we as consumers encouraged actually competition
2015-12-23 00:31:34	boombatower	just shortsighted
2015-12-23 00:31:59	boombatower	instead everyone buys the stunts and propaganda
2015-12-23 00:32:00	AlbertoP	boombatower, consumers do encourage competition by definition
2015-12-23 00:32:01	boombatower	and gives amd no money
2015-12-23 00:32:05	boombatower	how can they compete?
2015-12-23 00:32:11	boombatower	if they choose
2015-12-23 00:32:12	AlbertoP	they buy what works best for them
2015-12-23 00:32:19	boombatower	they buy the same thing over and over
2015-12-23 00:32:36	AlbertoP	maybe because that's what works for them?
2015-12-23 00:32:44	boombatower	but they don't know if something else might
2015-12-23 00:32:50	boombatower	then no comptetition
2015-12-23 00:32:56	boombatower	just first one to market or gain big share wins
2015-12-23 00:32:58	AlbertoP	or do you change brand of milk or fuel every time you buy, just to favor competition?
2015-12-23 00:32:59	boombatower	that's not comptetiion
2015-12-23 00:33:09	AlbertoP	you pick what you like, and use it until it works fine for you
2015-12-23 00:33:14	boombatower	AlbertoP: no, but I don't rule soemthing outright
2015-12-23 00:33:17	boombatower	I check now and again
2015-12-23 00:33:24	AlbertoP	you keep an eye open for new stuff when needed
2015-12-23 00:33:29	AlbertoP	but that's basically it
2015-12-23 00:34:24	boombatower	sad world man
2015-12-23 00:34:25	AlbertoP	I do, because ATI/AMD has proven to be unable to guarantee a consistent experience. Their drivers were ugly on Windows 98, they were on XP, they were on Linux... how many chances do you give them?
2015-12-23 00:34:26	boombatower	sad world
2015-12-23 00:34:40	boombatower	XP?
2015-12-23 00:34:43	boombatower	that's ages ago
2015-12-23 00:34:50	boombatower	haven't re-evaluated in a long time
2015-12-23 00:34:50	AlbertoP	that's not so long ago
2015-12-23 00:35:02	boombatower	k
2015-12-23 00:35:06	AlbertoP	I don't "re-evaluate" something that costs a lot
2015-12-23 00:35:11	AlbertoP	I buy what I know wors
2015-12-23 00:35:13	AlbertoP	works
2015-12-23 00:35:33	AlbertoP	especially because I use a laptop, and I can't do much trial and error :)
2015-12-23 00:35:36	boombatower	again, I'm done. "whatever works" is not a reason. do it, but not a reason
2015-12-23 00:35:47	boombatower	it's a logical fallacy
2015-12-23 00:35:51	boombatower	implies others don't
2015-12-23 00:36:05	AlbertoP	boombatower, it implies I don't trust the other
2015-12-23 00:36:13	boombatower	for instance still true today I can get far better performance/$$$ with amd
2015-12-23 00:36:15	boombatower	cpu and gpu
2015-12-23 00:36:16	AlbertoP	not that it cannot work for you
2015-12-23 00:36:20	AlbertoP	it's that simple
2015-12-23 00:36:26	AlbertoP	with CPU's it's even simpler...
2015-12-23 00:36:34	AlbertoP	Intel is way ahead
2015-12-23 00:36:44	boombatower	on the top of the line
2015-12-23 00:36:50	boombatower	not what most people buy
2015-12-23 00:36:57	boombatower	but again they don't buy it because they compare
2015-12-23 00:37:01	boombatower	they buy it becuase "ooo intel"
2015-12-23 00:37:22	AlbertoP	well I do computational work, so at work we buy Xeons...
2015-12-23 00:37:29	AlbertoP	sorry but AMD does not have a competitor
2015-12-23 00:38:17	AlbertoP	I don't know how they are doing on laptops these days though
2015-12-23 00:38:22	CygniX	good news, someone is using my bank card in a city 50 miles away from here
2015-12-23 00:38:26	AlbertoP	mostly, I don't see them much
2015-12-23 00:38:33	AlbertoP	CygniX, LOL
2015-12-23 00:38:38	CygniX	they already put in over $200
2015-12-23 00:38:46	boombatower	nice
2015-12-23 00:38:50	AlbertoP	CygniX, hopefully your bank blocked it?
2015-12-23 00:38:59	CygniX	I called and disabled the card
2015-12-23 00:39:21	AlbertoP	will your bank refund you?
2015-12-23 00:39:31	CygniX	yes
2015-12-23 00:39:34	AlbertoP	ok
2015-12-23 00:40:12	CygniX	the alert system is how I knew. but it's still too slow.
2015-12-23 00:40:25	AlbertoP	well that's why there is fraud protection :P
2015-12-23 00:40:26	CygniX	it should have been immediate instead of 2 hours after the crime.
2015-12-23 00:40:45	AlbertoP	that's weird
2015-12-23 00:41:03	AlbertoP	usually my bank sends emails on transactions, if you set them up
2015-12-23 00:41:21	boombatower	another problem that would disappear by nature if we had push banking instead of pull
2015-12-23 00:41:22	AlbertoP	GeekoSMS to firebird "I keep trying to use AlbertoP 's card for flies, and it gets denied!!!"
2015-12-23 00:41:23	boombatower	but oh well
2015-12-23 00:41:26	boombatower	people "choose what works"
2015-12-23 00:41:40	AlbertoP	push banking?
2015-12-23 00:41:55	boombatower	like crypto. can't pull money by just knowing account number
2015-12-23 00:42:24	AlbertoP	boombatower, two-factors?
2015-12-23 00:42:29	boombatower	improvement
2015-12-23 00:42:33	CygniX	I am now wondering how the card got comprimised whether my credit cards too are affected.
2015-12-23 00:42:46	AlbertoP	CygniX, did you use an ATM recently?
2015-12-23 00:42:47	CygniX	"PURCH W/O PIN"
2015-12-23 00:42:54	CygniX	AlbertoP: no
2015-12-23 00:43:15	CygniX	it was done without pin, so more than likely, the number was lifted onto another plastic
2015-12-23 00:43:18	AlbertoP	well CC's are safer...
2015-12-23 00:43:30	AlbertoP	how is it possible
2015-12-23 00:43:36	CygniX	oh, you don't know
2015-12-23 00:43:45	AlbertoP	for $200 PIN is required
2015-12-23 00:43:55	AlbertoP	should be above 50...
2015-12-23 00:44:03	AlbertoP	well if they didn't split...
2015-12-23 00:44:15	CygniX	if you use your card at gas stations for example, they put in a sniffer that takes the card number
2015-12-23 00:44:24	AlbertoP	that I know
2015-12-23 00:44:28	CygniX	and then, the put it on another plastic
2015-12-23 00:44:30	AlbertoP	I am just asking why no PIN...

2015-12-23 22:48:24	n00boty	"i don't know who is the more st0pid person. the person who writes a book or the person who reads a book"
2015-12-23 22:49:09	n00boty	maybe the MOST st)PID person is the person who is born into the world and makes stuff  HARD TO SEE!!!"
2015-12-23 22:49:28	n00boty	CAM FTW!
2015-12-23 22:49:52	n00boty	crap is crap and crap is cheap and crap is cheap and
2015-12-23 22:50:42	n00boty	look .. star wars was "milked" to the extrem" .. i agree
2015-12-23 22:51:25	n00boty	special genectical lines are a big .. well ... taboo or no-no to mention
2015-12-23 22:51:42	n00boty	monrachies are sucha thing? maybe?
2015-12-23 22:52:30	n00boty	well ... we are short and that's that ^_^
2015-12-23 22:54:03	n00boty	the only thing cool about "star-trek:V8" is ... we got compressed from about 230 square kilometers to ..hmmm ... maybe 30 square meters ... which is really a feat all in its self
2015-12-23 22:55:17	n00boty	so my take of all this is .. either the force is real and we got to NSA it or it's complete rubbish and we got like a bad director to botch killing the cow
2015-12-23 22:55:59	n00boty	btw theres a hollywood movie about how to kill cows "humanly"
2015-12-23 22:56:11	n00boty	strange but true
2015-12-23 22:58:32	n00boty	ok. i get it
2015-12-23 22:59:19	n00boty	the force ... i have it... like per genetics and then trekkies think that you can just wield it indiscraminatly ...
2015-12-23 22:59:27	n00boty	BULLSHIT!
2015-12-23 23:00:02	n00boty	you have to have the disposition to wield the force .. and then it needs  dicsipline
2015-12-23 23:00:44	n00boty	so even if your papa is han solo and you moma is leila you dont just get to push force buttons ...
2015-12-23 23:01:44	n00boty	and that;s why this good-ahir-do guy (which has  funny name anyway) can never ever do what he does .. and which is just a testament to our times about cracy
2015-12-23 23:04:03	n00boty	yoi can have great calcium skelletal whats it called suporting bone structure and great oxygen metabolism .. it oesnt mean you just get to touch the force ...
2015-12-23 23:04:18	n00boty	same for "moral" and "politeness:"
2015-12-23 23:06:00	n00boty	well anyways ... i will never forget the treatment i got when i got to visit a more rich star wars fans family" their kids got all the toys .. and ta-da .. reall jedi master like they said "you annot play with it, it's mine" fucking treekiess in diguise
2015-12-23 23:06:39	n00boty	boing?
2015-12-23 23:07:01	n00boty	well sorry i didnt mean trekkies ...
2015-12-23 23:07:08	n00boty	maybe they were just st0pid
2015-12-23 23:08:21	n00boty	there's this "other" world that we have toys off but her in the reall world you cannot play withe idols of the other world which we deem giving moral directives ...
2015-12-23 23:08:24	n00boty	lo
2015-12-23 23:08:25	n00boty	lol
2015-12-23 23:10:08	n00boty	look it's just a bad movie made by a director who has to feed 20'000 kids and acctually only cares about getting the chance to make a trekkie movie. the universe for n00bs ^_^
2015-12-23 23:11:31	n00boty	?
2015-12-23 23:11:37	n00boty	ignore list?

2015-12-24 21:51:35	CygniX	AlbertoP: you are right, I had to force one card to enable it. but I don't think it would have helped in my cased
2015-12-24 21:52:00	CygniX	I think my card was cloned and used without pin requirement
2015-12-24 21:52:22	AlbertoP	CygniX, well for chip-enbled cards, they are forcing to use the chip, so if a PIN is required, and it's not stolen too...
2015-12-24 21:52:31	CygniX	pin is generally requested on non-teller machines
2015-12-24 21:53:54	AlbertoP	uh?
2015-12-24 21:54:03	AlbertoP	it should be required for any transaction, in theory
2015-12-24 21:54:42	CygniX	it should but it's not required.
2015-12-24 21:54:46	AlbertoP	but it seems it's considered annoying, so they dropped the requirement... which makes the chip useless
2015-12-24 21:54:58	AlbertoP	and makes those cards NOT accepted abroad...
2015-12-24 21:55:04	AlbertoP	just experienced that at a gas pump here
2015-12-24 21:55:14	AlbertoP	the transaction starts...
2015-12-24 21:55:17	AlbertoP	it asks a PIN
2015-12-24 21:55:20	AlbertoP	there is no PIN...
2015-12-24 21:55:24	AlbertoP	you can't use it
2015-12-24 21:55:25	AlbertoP	:P
2015-12-24 21:55:27	CygniX	well, you won't be able to use it online if every transaction requires pin
2015-12-24 21:55:50	AlbertoP	CygniX, online there is SecureCode for MC and Visa has it's own too
2015-12-24 21:56:07	Mir	AlbertoP: you can sign on cards with a CHIP
2015-12-24 21:56:15	AlbertoP	they have been enabled out of the US for a good 10 years
2015-12-24 21:56:36	AlbertoP	Mir, yes I know... but it's not any safer than without a chip
2015-12-24 21:56:53	CygniX	going  off line for a few minutes though will still be here, but in spirit only.

2015-12-27 23:43:51	AlbertoP	CygniX, it's free to US numbers.
2015-12-27 23:44:00	CygniX	ah, correct
2015-12-27 23:44:03	AlbertoP	CygniX, same for Fi
2015-12-27 23:44:19	AlbertoP	CygniX, with wireless I meant "not wifi"
2015-12-27 23:44:37	CygniX	sorry, my mistake
2015-12-27 23:44:39	AlbertoP	np
2015-12-27 23:44:54	AlbertoP	CygniX, did you check if the problem was temporary?
2015-12-27 23:44:59	AlbertoP	maybe some work in the area?
2015-12-27 23:45:03	CygniX	there wasnt
2015-12-27 23:45:17	AlbertoP	is that area covered according their map?
2015-12-27 23:45:57	AlbertoP	you can bug them on witter :P

2015-12-27 23:48:27	AlbertoP	what does the map report?
2015-12-27 23:48:33	CygniX	daytona beach/airport area
2015-12-27 23:48:45	AlbertoP	uhm
2015-12-27 23:48:55	AlbertoP	it's very strange they have poor coverage there
2015-12-27 23:49:36	CygniX	their map shows 4G LTE
2015-12-27 23:49:56	AlbertoP	that's what I would expect too
2015-12-27 23:50:01	AlbertoP	I mean, airport...
2015-12-27 23:50:08	AlbertoP	they definitely want it covered

2015-12-27 23:51:39	AlbertoP	win phone
2015-12-27 23:51:57	AlbertoP	the lumia I had used to have better reception
2015-12-27 23:52:16	AlbertoP	the Nexus 5x seem OK
2015-12-27 23:52:39	AlbertoP	but well I had it for a month, so I can't really tell anything definitive
2015-12-27 23:53:10	AlbertoP	and if Fi connects to Wi-Fi, the signal is the wifi one :P
2015-12-27 23:53:46	CygniX	I can count on one hand how many times I have used wifi calling.
2015-12-27 23:54:01	CygniX	never really cared for it.
2015-12-27 23:54:11	AlbertoP	well Fi does it on its own... no control over it
2015-12-27 23:54:19	AlbertoP	the only thing you can do is to switch wifi off
2015-12-27 23:54:26	CygniX	at work, where tmo is dead, I tried it and it was a fail
2015-12-27 23:54:58	AlbertoP	also Fi supposedly can transit from wifi to wireless and back without dropping
2015-12-27 23:55:07	AlbertoP	I have not tried, but call quality is OK
2015-12-27 23:55:20	CygniX	I think with tmo is either or
2015-12-27 23:55:39	AlbertoP	yes
2015-12-27 23:55:47	AlbertoP	it depends on the device
2015-12-27 23:55:54	AlbertoP	but T-Mobile are jerks...
2015-12-27 23:56:13	AlbertoP	they do not share their implementation, and they put security settings in their firmware
2015-12-27 23:56:24	AlbertoP	while they happily could do it with SIM
2015-12-27 23:56:41	AlbertoP	then they bitch about phone manufacturers not "talking" to them
2015-12-27 23:57:15	AlbertoP	the only phone that works out of the box on TMob with wifi calling is the iPhone...
2015-12-27 23:57:32	AlbertoP	because well nobody wants to be the carrier that causes troubles to iphone users
2015-12-27 23:57:55	CygniX	you mean without tmo firmware?
2015-12-27 23:58:21	AlbertoP	yes
2015-12-27 23:58:33	AlbertoP	an unlocked iphone works out of the box with wifi calling on tmob
2015-12-27 23:58:50	AlbertoP	other unlocked phones do not because they explicitly kick them out...
2015-12-27 23:59:10	CygniX	wait, does Fi have the equipment installment plan?
2015-12-27 23:59:29	AlbertoP	you can, yes
2015-12-27 23:59:34	AlbertoP	if you buy the device with Fi
2015-12-27 23:59:47	AlbertoP	meaning when you sign the contract
2015-12-27 23:59:54	AlbertoP	well "contract"
2015-12-28 00:00:53	CygniX	does their interface allow disabling internationally calling?
2015-12-28 00:01:07	AlbertoP	the app does
2015-12-28 00:01:14	AlbertoP	Fi has an app
2015-12-28 00:01:20	AlbertoP	you control from there
2015-12-28 00:01:45	CygniX	I have that on one of my tmo accounts
2015-12-28 00:01:59	CygniX	we had an  "incident" once
2015-12-28 00:02:19	AlbertoP	well if the phone user wants to turn it on, he can though
2015-12-28 00:02:23	AlbertoP	it's not "locked"
2015-12-28 00:02:48	AlbertoP	if it's just to avoid problems with misplaced calls, it works
2015-12-28 00:08:30	CygniX	their cheapest device is $330.00

2015-12-28 23:21:45	AlbertoP	I switched to a software-based authenticator

2015-12-28 23:25:18	AlbertoP	CygniX, well it's convenient
2015-12-28 23:25:59	AlbertoP	cra1g321, many answers...
2015-12-28 23:26:08	AlbertoP	maybe they know the sites, but not the passwords...
2015-12-28 23:26:27	AlbertoP	maybe they have a way to search encrypted portions and compare...
2015-12-28 23:26:30	AlbertoP	I have no idea
2015-12-28 23:27:04	AlbertoP	I have access to email on my phone or device via client, so I didn't have to do anything like that
2015-12-28 23:27:13	AlbertoP	just clicked on a link, confirmed, done
2015-12-28 23:27:32	cra1g321	ok i found the support message they sent
2015-12-28 23:27:38	cra1g321	"We can disable the authentication from our side provided that you can answer the following info below to confirm your identity"

2015-12-28 23:27:50	cra1g321	2. when was the last time you changed your masterpassword
2015-12-28 23:27:52	AlbertoP	I don't know LOL
2015-12-28 23:27:57	cra1g321	3. the IP that you are using to access this account (use https://www.whatismyip.com/)
2015-12-28 23:28:01	cra1g321	4. provide at least 5 unique sites saved on your vault (not facebook, twitter,gmail, yahoo..etc) It must be unique.
2015-12-28 23:28:11	AlbertoP	unique?
2015-12-28 23:28:21	AlbertoP	what does that mean?
2015-12-28 23:28:23	AlbertoP	your bank?
2015-12-28 23:28:29	AlbertoP	your porn shop?
2015-12-28 23:28:32	cra1g321	lol
2015-12-28 23:28:36	AlbertoP	what's "unique"?
2015-12-28 23:28:39	AlbertoP	that's nonsense
2015-12-28 23:28:43	cra1g321	i did a few websites that i knew just wernt email
2015-12-28 23:28:50	AlbertoP	they should have NOT asked stupid questions like those
2015-12-28 23:29:11	cra1g321	looking at it again makes me re-think things...
2015-12-28 23:29:18	AlbertoP	I don't remember WHEN I created the account... it was like in 2010 or so
2015-12-28 23:29:54	AlbertoP	well, they were bought by LogMeIn...
2015-12-28 23:29:59	AlbertoP	trust went downhill
2015-12-28 23:30:15	cra1g321	think i'll export my vault while im signed in :)
2015-12-28 23:30:39	AlbertoP	you don't need to :D
2015-12-28 23:30:49	cra1g321	i'm tempted to post in some forum about that question,
2015-12-28 23:30:57	cra1g321	see if i get any info about why it was asked :/
2015-12-28 23:31:43	AlbertoP	let me know >:)

2015-12-28 23:56:26	AlbertoP	but if you need to work with foreign people, forget about it
2015-12-28 23:56:35	CygniX	oh
2015-12-28 23:56:57	CygniX	I get foreign transaction into my account a few times a year
2015-12-28 23:57:24	AlbertoP	US BANK does not have any clue about that... their credit cards are pain abroad, and if you need to wire something, they are so expensive it's not even worth thinking about it...
2015-12-28 23:57:30	AlbertoP	getting them is fine
2015-12-28 23:57:36	AlbertoP	doing them ewwww
2015-12-28 23:57:53	CygniX	I see
2015-12-28 23:58:05	AlbertoP	I ended up using Western Union FX... because frankly banks in the US are overcharging for a foreign transfer
2015-12-28 23:58:33	AlbertoP	fee on the exchange, +50$/transaction for a wire transfer...it's plain ludicrous and outdated
2015-12-28 23:59:22	CygniX	$50 transaction fee is high but not that bad
2015-12-28 23:59:26	AlbertoP	lol?
2015-12-28 23:59:37	CygniX	incoming is about $15
2015-12-28 23:59:50	AlbertoP	why would I pay for incoming again?
2015-12-28 23:59:54	AlbertoP	the bank does nothing
2015-12-29 00:00:06	CygniX	"service" fee
2015-12-29 00:00:23	AlbertoP	foreign bank transfer in the EU -> 2 to 5 euros with an Italian bank account...
2015-12-29 00:00:34	AlbertoP	receiving money should cost zero...
2015-12-29 00:00:50	AlbertoP	the bank is already making money on it
2015-12-29 00:01:18	CygniX	let me see if I can find the last foreign fee I was charged
2015-12-29 00:01:44	CygniX	yep, exactly $15.00
2015-12-29 00:01:54	AlbertoP	for credit cards, I have none
2015-12-29 00:02:25	AlbertoP	for tranfers, better use private services in the US... paypal, western union... waaaaay cheaper
2015-12-29 00:02:26	CygniX	"What is this fee? This is a fee charged for funds being wired into or out of your account from another financial institution."
2015-12-29 00:02:34	AlbertoP	yes...
2015-12-29 00:02:47	AlbertoP	they asked me 50$ to do a wire...
2015-12-29 00:02:54	AlbertoP	western union FX -> 5
2015-12-29 00:03:59	AlbertoP	I'm not sure why fees are so high tbh... maybe some tax?
2015-12-29 00:05:36	CygniX	service fee
2015-12-29 00:05:42	CygniX	whatever the hell that means
2015-12-29 00:06:32	AlbertoP	right but the bank may have to pay something to the feds...
2015-12-29 00:06:43	AlbertoP	the wire transfer system is federal
2015-12-29 00:07:17	AlbertoP	and it seems to cost way more than ACH (which I don't get why it can't be used internationally, since any country has something like that)
2015-12-29 00:07:27	AlbertoP	that's actually how WU FX does it...
2015-12-29 00:07:32	AlbertoP	they don't really wire
2015-12-29 00:07:59	AlbertoP	but I guess they work as man in the middle
2015-12-29 00:08:31	CygniX	the more money you have the less fees you pay
2015-12-29 00:08:45	CygniX	the world is upside down
2015-12-29 00:08:55	AlbertoP	not really, it's based on information
2015-12-29 00:09:18	AlbertoP	if you spend some time exploring, you find solutions :P
2015-12-29 00:09:41	CygniX	take for example the credit system and interest rates
2015-12-29 00:10:28	AlbertoP	CygniX, Ally Bank does not charge any fee to receive wire transfers, for example ;)
2015-12-29 00:10:39	CygniX	if you are poor you are more likely the have not so perfect credit which translates to higher interest rates
2015-12-29 00:10:51	AlbertoP	well yes
2015-12-29 00:11:05	AlbertoP	but frankly speaking, credit is just a way to live in lie for many...

2015-12-29 01:15:05	CygniX	So after some readings due to my recently compromised debit card, it appears that it is advice to not use it often and instead use a credit card.
2015-12-29 01:15:20	CygniX	of course pay off your credit balance immediately
2015-12-29 01:16:03	AlbertoP	well monthly
2015-12-29 01:16:14	AlbertoP	CygniX, a credit card may also give some money back...
2015-12-29 01:16:20	CygniX	yea
2015-12-29 01:16:37	CygniX	that was one reason to use credit card instead of debit.

2015-12-29 01:18:08	CygniX	AlbertoP: the reason to pay of the balance immediately before it report is due to credit  line utilization which plays a big role for your overall score.
2015-12-29 01:18:32	AlbertoP	CygniX, uhm I don't really care... I just set autopay
2015-12-29 01:18:55	cra1g321	i only have a debit card
2015-12-29 01:19:07	 *	AlbertoP has a policy of not using credit anyway (well maybe for a house but that's not in my plans right now)
2015-12-29 01:19:07	CygniX	but do you understand what I was trying to say about utilization, AlbertoP?
2015-12-29 01:19:12	AlbertoP	yes
2015-12-29 01:19:26	cra1g321	i try to use my card as little as possible
2015-12-29 01:19:37	AlbertoP	I do the opposite...
2015-12-29 01:19:49	AlbertoP	my card gives me 1.5% back, so EVERYTHING goes on it
2015-12-29 01:19:55	cra1g321	lol
2015-12-29 01:19:56	AlbertoP	>:)
2015-12-29 01:20:13	CygniX	that's a good point and such is why am transitioning
2015-12-29 01:20:24	cra1g321	i applied for a "junior IT Technician" job today, basically it involves wiping data off customer's hard drives
2015-12-29 01:20:55	cra1g321	so im just wondering if i get it, do i bring my own microwave ;)
2015-12-29 01:22:27	CygniX	AlbertoP: my silly electric company wants to charge $2+ for me to use credit card and auto pay.
2015-12-29 01:23:06	AlbertoP	CygniX, in such case, I pay with bank Bill Pay >:)
2015-12-29 01:23:14	CygniX	yep
2015-12-29 01:23:22	 *	AlbertoP is very picky when it comes to money (and well, Maths)
2015-12-29 01:23:39	CygniX	would have loved to get the reward points that comes with paying power bill with credit card
2015-12-29 01:23:58	AlbertoP	CygniX, not worth... those fees are insane
2015-12-29 01:24:05	CygniX	agree
2015-12-29 01:25:58	AlbertoP	can't they just use something cheaper to process cards?

2015-12-29 01:26:50	CygniX	AlbertoP: the want you to use your bank account connected directly instead which has no charge.
2015-12-29 01:26:52	AlbertoP	cra1g321, I hope he doesn't, but it's his life...
2015-12-29 01:26:57	CygniX	it's by design
2015-12-29 01:27:01	AlbertoP	CygniX, no
2015-12-29 01:27:05	AlbertoP	they charge also with that
2015-12-29 01:27:13	CygniX	mine does not charge
2015-12-29 01:27:19	AlbertoP	the ONLY way to have it free is to use Pay Bill

2015-12-29 20:16:18	Mir_	well
2015-12-29 20:16:46	Mir_	i still dont know what failed as when i used the rescuecd and the grub2 installer

2015-12-29 20:19:43	revealed	Mabye the Steven Hawkings could explain? Somethink like an anomalie?
2015-12-29 20:20:28	Mir_	no
2015-12-29 20:20:54	Mir_	i belive like every other error message in the install there needs to be a detail option
2015-12-29 20:21:14	Mir_	if i dont know how it is failing or why i cant fix it

2015-12-29 20:22:41	revealed	why do i fear you are working with a serial console?
2015-12-29 20:23:24	revealed	This is not only about verbose boot log. You mean especially grub2 or dracut or so?
2015-12-29 20:23:52	Mir	revealed: when a package fails on install from the DVD or net install medium you get a error message and an option to see the details
2015-12-29 20:24:04	revealed	yes
2015-12-29 20:24:22	Mir	when NTP fails you get a detailed message
2015-12-29 20:24:43	Mir	when grub fails it asks you if you want to redo the boot options
2015-12-29 20:24:43	revealed	cant remember NTP seriously failed but i guess so, yes
2015-12-29 20:25:03	revealed	ehm no grub will just finish
2015-12-29 20:25:08	Mir	as if that would fix whatever underlying issue there was for grub2-install failing to do its job
2015-12-29 20:25:43	revealed	or wait
2015-12-29 20:25:50	revealed	you talk of installation of grub package?

2015-12-29 20:26:23	Mir	yeeeessss
2015-12-29 20:26:35	Mir	this isnt the installation of the grub package

2015-12-29 20:26:41	Mir	grub is installed
2015-12-29 20:26:44	Mir	\BUT
2015-12-29 20:27:02	Mir	when writting the bootloader information it fails
2015-12-29 20:27:25	Mir	there is no point in having grub installed if it has nothing to do

2015-12-29 20:28:19	Mir	but thats because of a bug in BTRFS

2016-01-02 01:52:56	CygniX	hmmm apple top the list of most vulnerabilities
2016-01-02 01:53:34	CygniX	latest Tumbleweed is two thumbs up.
2016-01-02 01:54:20	AlbertoP	the list is not very well done
2016-01-02 01:54:30	AlbertoP	what version of OS X?
2016-01-02 01:54:55	CygniX	I am guessing supported versions
2016-01-02 01:55:05	AlbertoP	it lists all versions of Windows separately, but also a generic "Windows"
2016-01-02 01:55:13	CygniX	I noticed that
2016-01-02 01:55:59	boombatower	most vulnerabilities doesn't speak to severity (not defending apple)
2016-01-02 01:56:17	boombatower	security people tend to call just about anything a security vul
2016-01-02 01:56:32	boombatower	even if virtually impossible to exploit
2016-01-02 01:56:35	AlbertoP	well it's also true that some software is most used, scrutinized and such
2016-01-02 01:56:41	boombatower	indeed
2016-01-02 01:57:06	boombatower	had one on a small thing I wrote
2016-01-02 01:57:18	boombatower	had to be logged in a user/1 (equivalent to root) in order to use it
2016-01-02 01:57:25	boombatower	so bascially if you already had permission to do anything
2016-01-02 01:57:34	boombatower	you could use this exploit to do it a different way..
2016-01-02 01:57:36	boombatower	;)
2016-01-02 01:57:39	boombatower	long time ago
2016-01-02 01:57:58	CygniX	actually Microsoft had the most vulnerabilities by my addition
2016-01-02 01:58:07	boombatower	oh noes math
2016-01-02 01:58:31	CygniX	of course, that doesn't take into account severity
2016-01-02 01:59:01	AlbertoP	CygniX, and it does not remove overlap
2016-01-02 01:59:18	AlbertoP	uhm is Vista still supported?!
2016-01-02 01:59:28	boombatower	surely if they jsut finally killed XP
2016-01-02 01:59:34	CygniX	your previous statement was correct that the  list is a bit, meh, AlbertoP
2016-01-02 01:59:36	boombatower	next on the block though
2016-01-02 01:59:58	AlbertoP	CygniX, it's just a raw list from CVE
2016-01-02 02:00:02	cra1g321	one OS has 1,000 people looking at its code and they find 100 exploits, another OS has 10 people looking at it and they find 5 exploits, which one is more secure ?
2016-01-02 02:00:29	boombatower	well, plus we have no way of verifing that the closed source OSs don't have more
2016-01-02 02:00:38	boombatower	since they can put whatever they want in update
2016-01-02 02:00:43	CygniX	well, it depends, but one could infer the one with most found vulnerabilities, cra1g321
2016-01-02 02:00:45	cra1g321	i think just because a OS gets more vulnerbility reports doesnt mean its less secure
2016-01-02 02:00:51	AlbertoP	we don't even know how many unknown bugs are in FOSS either :P
2016-01-02 02:01:04	boombatower	exactly
2016-01-02 02:01:04	AlbertoP	given the state of basic stuff, I lost my faith
2016-01-02 02:01:07	boombatower	just a lot of nothingness
2016-01-02 02:01:15	AlbertoP	cra1g321, indeed
2016-01-02 02:01:39	AlbertoP	Windows 10 is doing well though :P
2016-01-02 02:01:43	AlbertoP	53...
2016-01-02 02:01:54	boombatower	ew
2016-01-02 02:02:08	AlbertoP	I guess in part because it benefits from the others, and from the community testing
2016-01-02 02:03:22	AlbertoP	I need to change password to my MS account uhmmmm what the hell do I pick? :)
2016-01-02 02:03:41	cra1g321	paste it here so we can see if it is a good password
2016-01-02 02:03:47	boombatower	yes
2016-01-02 02:03:56	AlbertoP	cra1g321, would do no good
2016-01-02 02:04:07	cra1g321	also can i have your email address ? need to email you something :0
2016-01-02 02:04:08	cra1g321	;)
2016-01-02 02:04:14	boombatower	hehe
2016-01-02 02:04:15	AlbertoP	cra1g321, still no good
2016-01-02 02:04:17	cra1g321	also whats your date of birth ?
2016-01-02 02:04:19	cra1g321	just making conversation :D
2016-01-02 02:04:25	AlbertoP	nope
2016-01-02 02:04:27	boombatower	asl
2016-01-02 02:04:27	AlbertoP	no good :P
2016-01-02 02:04:48	AlbertoP	you either steal my phone, or you are out of business!
2016-01-02 02:05:04	boombatower	hey, I'll upgrade the screen on your phone for free
2016-01-02 02:05:17	AlbertoP	:)
2016-01-02 02:05:51	CygniX	boombatower: old enough, yes, near you. :P
2016-01-02 02:05:57	boombatower	:)
2016-01-02 02:06:29	AlbertoP	actually there is a way...
2016-01-02 02:06:40	AlbertoP	if you steal my laptop while unlocked...
2016-01-02 02:07:00	boombatower	I mean has to be unlocked if you want me to install those free upgrades
2016-01-02 02:07:12	AlbertoP	:)
2016-01-02 02:07:28	AlbertoP	it does that by itself, and quite effectively! Ask firebird :P
2016-01-02 02:07:42	AlbertoP	Windows 10 has become self-sufficient in that sense... LOL
2016-01-02 02:07:59	boombatower	reminds me of the whitehat talk about the guy having his mac desktop stolen
2016-01-02 02:08:05	cra1g321	^ saw that
2016-01-02 02:08:10	boombatower	and getting it back due to semi-bad security practices
2016-01-02 02:12:06	AlbertoP	done
2016-01-02 02:12:34	AlbertoP	and 1 ms later they emailed to say it happened...

2016-01-02 02:30:53	AlbertoP	firebird, ALL the MS apps wanted a re-login... in spite of having the token already. Paranoids!
2016-01-02 02:34:13	AlbertoP	nightfuri, I have a blog...

2016-01-02 02:35:56	AlbertoP	I never used blogger
2016-01-02 02:36:07	boombatower	back in the day
2016-01-02 02:39:09	boombatower	CygniX: since we were on the subject last night: "Obama to meet attorney general to curb U.S. gun violence: Frustrated with little action from Congress, Obama has vowed to use "whatever power this office holds" to put in place gun control measures through executive action, which does not require congressional approval." fits the style
2016-01-02 02:40:18	boombatower	congress not doing what you want, no problem...executive order
2016-01-02 02:41:51	AlbertoP	well congress has not done much for 8 years...
2016-01-02 02:41:58	boombatower	no excuse
2016-01-02 02:42:13	boombatower	congress doesn't do what I want either, doesn't mean I break the law
2016-01-02 02:42:27	CygniX	boombatower: well, let's wait and see what the executive action entails
2016-01-02 02:42:28	AlbertoP	I would agree, but still, problems are there, and solutions should be found. They are just blocking things based on principles.
2016-01-02 02:42:35	boombatower	CygniX: agree, but I can see it coming
2016-01-02 02:42:43	boombatower	AlbertoP: indeed "found"
2016-01-02 02:42:45	boombatower	they haven't
2016-01-02 02:42:48	boombatower	and don't care to
2016-01-02 02:42:49	AlbertoP	CygniX, he said what, and it's perfectly fine. More in-depth background checks.
2016-01-02 02:42:59	CygniX	By all acount, the President has something cooking
2016-01-02 02:42:59	boombatower	he said no-fly list

2016-01-02 02:43:20	boombatower	in his address during primetime he did

2016-01-02 02:43:53	AlbertoP	a no-fly list for gun owners would put a large % of the US population on the ground, and would not be acceptable

2016-01-02 02:47:31	boombatower	but we'll see how enforced

2016-01-02 02:49:45	boombatower	what does "right" entail
2016-01-02 02:50:14	AlbertoP	in a proper amount of salted water and for the time written on the box (and not until it dissolves :P)
2016-01-02 02:50:26	AlbertoP	it also entails not washing it after :)
2016-01-02 02:50:42	boombatower	never used salt water, but timing, and rinse in strainer yes
2016-01-02 02:50:55	AlbertoP	Oo
2016-01-02 02:50:57	boombatower	for kicks I'll try it
2016-01-02 02:51:15	boombatower	how does one know proper amount
2016-01-02 02:52:07	AlbertoP	rule of thumb says 1 L / 100 grams

2016-01-02 02:52:37	AlbertoP	but the box should say it :P
2016-01-02 02:52:55	AlbertoP	uhm pasta is sold in grams!
2016-01-02 02:53:04	boombatower	oz baby
2016-01-02 02:53:11	AlbertoP	at least Barilla uses grams :P
2016-01-02 02:53:14	boombatower	probably has both on box
2016-01-02 02:53:28	boombatower	but that doesn't indicate amount of salt
2016-01-02 02:53:38	AlbertoP	well that's tricky LOL

2016-01-02 20:36:00	cisc	its all in the mastering, but CD's have a better dynamic range than vinyl, without the pops or hiss

2016-01-02 20:52:47	shantorn	well its older, amd x4 quad 3 ghz
2016-01-02 20:53:12	curiouseag	shantorn, did you edit it to s24le?
2016-01-02 20:53:27	shantorn	didnt see those instructions sorry
2016-01-02 20:53:48	curiouseag	shantorn, that edit it and remove the ; in front
2016-01-02 20:53:52	shantorn	and remove the ; from the front?
2016-01-02 20:53:56	curiouseag	yes
2016-01-02 20:53:57	shantorn	got it
2016-01-02 20:54:03	microchip_	curiouseag: if driver doesn't support those, pulse will do sampling. Better check if driver supports that first
2016-01-02 20:54:14	microchip_	read teh code! :P
2016-01-02 20:54:16	curiouseag	you now got 96000 and s24le right?
2016-01-02 20:54:42	shantorn	i do but i believe i read the driver doesnt suppor tthat but i may be wrong
2016-01-02 20:54:45	curiouseag	microchip_, we did, and alsa lied, we will test after pulse restart

2016-01-02 21:02:25	shantorn	thats what i thought, thanks for trying
2016-01-02 21:02:57	curiouseag	we can increase the sample algorith instead, but it does not much, and its cpu heavy
2016-01-02 21:03:35	curiouseag	shantorn, its = resample-method = speex-float-1 (you can change the 1 to 3 or 4)
2016-01-02 21:03:39	shantorn	nah its ok, ill just have to boot winders to listen to the high end business
2016-01-02 21:04:08	shantorn	its really to bad as i love using linux for my needs

2016-01-02 21:05:42	cisc	I suppose Leap is a bit more stable

2016-01-02 21:08:24	cisc	nah, this guy is older and is usually answer a lot of questions with snippets of good bash examples, just some people have problems with Leap, and TW for that matter that no matter how good their skills, their HW and Leap don't get along
2016-01-02 21:08:52	cisc	usually it boils down to Nvidia cards from what I can tell

2016-01-02 21:10:32	cisc	nouveau has a long way to go
2016-01-02 21:11:12	cisc	what ends up happening is there are 200 things people can do to tweak boot paramaters and get out of the nouveau jail, and get the Nvidia binary driver installed, but they get tired after step 5 and give up

2016-01-02 23:42:07	microchip_	thx
2016-01-02 23:42:13	sjraarke	Finally getting back to doing fun stuff again
2016-01-02 23:43:15	sjraarke	Nov and Dec weren't fun at all. Too much stress and messing with unwilling scripts
2016-01-02 23:45:01	sjraarke	Just fired up my Tumbleweed laptop for the first in about 6 weeks and it seems that they replaced just about everything.
2016-01-02 23:45:12	sjraarke	Well over 1K updates to chew on.
2016-01-02 23:45:24	microchip_	lol fun :)
2016-01-02 23:45:50	cra1g321	ouch lol
2016-01-02 23:46:01	sjraarke	Now testing to see how the updater handles it.
2016-01-02 23:46:17	sjraarke	Not looking good so far
2016-01-02 23:46:27	cra1g321	i think my debian jessie got about 15 during the past 6 weeks ;)
2016-01-02 23:48:50	sjraarke	Via "zypper ref && zypper up" I find out what and how many updates, then I let the updater handle it. So far it does it in bits and pieces
2016-01-02 23:49:14	cra1g321	zypper up i think will refresh the repos for you
2016-01-02 23:49:52	sjraarke	cra1g321: Correct, it will, but I'm a man of habbits :)
2016-01-02 23:50:14	Siju	to be really sure do: "zypper clean -a && zypper ref"
2016-01-02 23:50:46	sjraarke	I used to do "zypper ref -f && zypper up -l -y && zypper ps"
2016-01-02 23:52:04	sjraarke	I think the laptop wants me to reboot it because everything that is running at the moment is using deleted files :)
2016-01-02 23:53:25	sjraarke	Siju: I'm gonna use the "zypper clean -a" too. You can never be too sure :)
2016-01-02 23:54:22	Siju	sjraarke: better ... but ihmo only needed if you mix repos and prios
2016-01-02 23:55:24	sjraarke	TW boot screen looks better
2016-01-02 23:55:53	sjraarke	Siju: I don't mix anything atm. Only basic repos
2016-01-02 23:57:03	Siju	good ... but a least you need a clean -a if you want a full up/downgrade ... words very well
2016-01-02 23:58:12	sjraarke	Siju: Never used it before and all upgrades worked out okay.
2016-01-03 00:01:47	sjraarke	The updater handled everything, but it still buggers up with the error message

2016-01-03 01:44:42	AlbertoP	I said it in a friendly way
2016-01-03 01:44:58	CygniX	tried to sign up for uber, a fail.
2016-01-03 01:45:04	AlbertoP	uh?
2016-01-03 01:45:14	howi	is Lyft any good/better than uber?

2016-01-03 01:45:48	AlbertoP	CygniX, that's weird
2016-01-03 01:46:09	AlbertoP	but probably because it can be used only once?
2016-01-03 01:46:25	AlbertoP	or is it "permanent"?
2016-01-03 01:46:39	CygniX	They have no idea it's a virtual

2016-01-03 01:47:14	CygniX	I am thinking may be I made the expiration date too short

2016-01-03 01:47:30	AlbertoP	ok, then it should work :-?

2016-01-03 01:52:46	CygniX	I was chastised yesterday for not being married yet
2016-01-03 01:53:10	AlbertoP	CygniX, well that's not my point, I don't see marriage as a necessary step in life
2016-01-03 01:53:35	CygniX	AlbertoP: you haven't met my family :P
2016-01-03 01:53:51	AlbertoP	but uhm... I guess it's because a big professional step is coming, I feel like I should move on
2016-01-03 01:54:17	CygniX	You are being made Dean?
2016-01-03 01:54:29	AlbertoP	just tenured... next year

2016-01-03 01:59:01	CygniX	yea, am still investigating it
2016-01-03 02:00:43	AlbertoP	back to the topic, it's more about doing something that makes me happy, I guess... which would be *part* if what I do, a part that reduced to the minimum due to how things work in unis
2016-01-03 02:01:19	AlbertoP	marriage well...yeah, may or may not happen, I am not particularly worried about that...
2016-01-03 02:01:38	howi	do you um have a unix beard?
2016-01-03 02:02:00	CygniX	hmm, that question could mean a lot of things
2016-01-03 02:02:01	Mir	yes
2016-01-03 02:02:02	CygniX	lol
2016-01-03 02:02:04	AlbertoP	howi, no
2016-01-03 02:02:16	AlbertoP	:)

2016-01-03 02:04:49	CygniX	AlbertoP: lot's of people would kill to be in your position to be able to decide whether or not you want tenure at a good school.
2016-01-03 02:05:01	CygniX	So, not really a problem :)
2016-01-03 02:05:21	AlbertoP	CygniX, I am not in that position to be fair. It's not that I have an alternative to pick right now :)
2016-01-03 02:05:47	AlbertoP	let's put it this way...
2016-01-03 02:05:47	CygniX	Well, it seems like a posibility
2016-01-03 02:06:21	AlbertoP	I invested 8 years in the US + about 8 in .it to do that...
2016-01-03 02:07:02	AlbertoP	so on one hand there is a "little" concern to make a move I can't change back
2016-01-03 02:07:47	AlbertoP	on the other hand, there is the fact that uhm... I am really not convinced I "fit in" in all these years
2016-01-03 02:08:02	AlbertoP	and I agree, many would probably kill for it...
2016-01-03 02:08:14	CygniX	interesting, only you know best for yourself.
2016-01-03 02:08:29	AlbertoP	do I? LOL
2016-01-03 02:09:08	AlbertoP	if I look back, I would say all the decisions I took that led to successful things were made by chance :P
2016-01-03 02:09:24	CygniX	hmm
2016-01-03 02:09:31	AlbertoP	maybe an educated guess...
2016-01-03 02:10:26	AlbertoP	(note: I am not regretting what I did, just not so convinced it's what I should do forever) :)
2016-01-03 02:10:45	CygniX	Everyone goes through that
2016-01-03 02:10:54	AlbertoP	yes
2016-01-03 02:11:06	AlbertoP	well I guess details don't fit in a chat :P

2016-01-03 02:11:47	AlbertoP	at a price, yes
2016-01-03 02:12:07	AlbertoP	meaning, it's definitely not a risk-free step
2016-01-03 02:12:51	CygniX	there will of course always be a risk
2016-01-03 02:13:57	AlbertoP	well yes, but switching later is harder... you're older ;)
2016-01-03 02:14:04	AlbertoP	(and cost more)

2016-01-03 02:16:31	AlbertoP	no
2016-01-03 02:16:50	CygniX	I am a few years younger than you and I get it asked all the time
2016-01-03 02:16:53	AlbertoP	my dad used to mention it tangentially

2016-01-03 02:17:01	AlbertoP	but never insisted either
2016-01-03 02:17:14	AlbertoP	well, my mom and dad married late...
2016-01-03 02:17:42	AlbertoP	mom divorced once, in a time when in Italy divorce was seen extremely negative

2016-01-03 02:23:22	AlbertoP	her life definitely saw huge increase in rights
2016-01-03 02:23:46	CygniX	Women in the U.S. couldnt vote then
2016-01-03 02:24:05	AlbertoP	in Italy it was a mess due to fascism
2016-01-03 02:24:31	AlbertoP	vote was introduced relatively early, but suspended during the regime, and then re-introduced after WWII

2016-01-03 02:32:27	CygniX	How much is Silvio paying a month again in alimony?
2016-01-03 02:32:35	AlbertoP	hmm
2016-01-03 02:32:49	AlbertoP	I think it was reduced to 1 million now
2016-01-03 02:32:55	AlbertoP	but it used to be 3 million euros
2016-01-03 02:33:01	CygniX	ridiculous
2016-01-03 02:33:32	AlbertoP	well it's proportional to the lifestyle, I guess
2016-01-03 02:33:36	AlbertoP	but I agree...
2016-01-03 02:33:55	AlbertoP	if you are male, well, the risk of ending into poverty due to it is there
2016-01-03 02:34:15	AlbertoP	actually the government just created a support fund for divorced men due to it
2016-01-03 02:34:30	CygniX	lol
2016-01-03 02:34:42	AlbertoP	it's just nonsense how courts distribute costs
2016-01-03 02:34:46	CygniX	support fund for divorce men, this is got to be a joke
2016-01-03 02:35:26	AlbertoP	CygniX, it's actually true. There is a large % of men who ended up below the poverty level due to paying alimony...
2016-01-03 02:35:51	AlbertoP	so the gov created a fund to help paying it, in extreme cases
2016-01-03 02:36:11	AlbertoP	what would be needed is a reform of the legal system
2016-01-03 02:36:34	CygniX	perhaps they should restructure the alimony process and laws, instead of billing the public
2016-01-03 02:36:41	AlbertoP	it's nonsense that if you make, say 1k, you must pay 600 to your ex-wife, even if she works, and has a partner
2016-01-03 02:36:56	AlbertoP	CygniX, it's underway, but in the meantime...
2016-01-03 02:37:14	CygniX	O_o
2016-01-03 02:37:26	CygniX	that could drive people insane

2016-01-03 02:41:00	AlbertoP	but what was done after, is shared...
2016-01-03 02:41:31	AlbertoP	and the rest is decided in court (well there are some ways, but usually not as strong as you have)

2016-01-03 02:43:59	CygniX	maybe she knows a secret about him he doesn't want public
2016-01-03 02:44:04	AlbertoP	nah
2016-01-03 02:44:07	AlbertoP	it's common
2016-01-03 02:44:23	CygniX	what is considered legal age it?

2016-01-03 02:44:27	AlbertoP	he is probably paying less now because he is married again...
2016-01-03 02:44:28	CygniX	here it's 18
2016-01-03 02:44:31	AlbertoP	18
2016-01-03 02:44:41	AlbertoP	but no, legal age does not define the end of payments
2016-01-03 02:44:47	nenis43	What benefits shall I notice if I switch from Ubuntu GNOME to SUSE?
2016-01-03 02:45:01	CygniX	switch to KDE :)
2016-01-03 02:45:13	CygniX	you will be happier, which means longer life
2016-01-03 02:45:21	nenis43	I don't want the weight of KDE hanging over my hardware.
2016-01-03 02:45:29	AlbertoP	according to our consitution "parents are responsible of the education of their kids"... which courts interpret "if the kid is good at school, well, support until he graduates"
2016-01-03 02:45:47	CygniX	wow
2016-01-03 02:46:15	AlbertoP	CygniX, well keep in mind that education costs a fraction here...
2016-01-03 02:46:26	CygniX	Gnome is no lighter than KDE, in my view nenis43
2016-01-03 02:46:37	AlbertoP	it's more or less paying for food... but usually you do something LOL
2016-01-03 02:46:39	CygniX	AlbertoP: still.
2016-01-03 02:47:00	CygniX	I think it's crazy that you can force someone to pay for college tuition
2016-01-03 02:47:16	AlbertoP	we don't have tuitions
2016-01-03 02:47:33	AlbertoP	it's a fee to apply, but it's small
2016-01-03 02:47:34	CygniX	or whatever college cost entails
2016-01-03 02:47:34	nenis43	CygniX, Really?
2016-01-03 02:47:42	nenis43	I thought KDE is like a tractor trailer.
2016-01-03 02:47:43	CygniX	nenis43: that is just my view
2016-01-03 02:47:56	CygniX	nenis43: you could ask in #suse
2016-01-03 02:48:05	AlbertoP	CygniX, 1-2k/year
2016-01-03 02:48:16	AlbertoP	it's really not that much...
2016-01-03 02:48:18	nenis43	CygniX, I'm using Ubuntu MATE right now.
2016-01-03 02:48:31	nenis43	It's very simple and light.
2016-01-03 02:48:42	nenis43	MATE is tweaked GNOME 2.0.
2016-01-03 02:49:11	CygniX	nenis43: I thought you meant Gnome 3.x
2016-01-03 02:49:23	CygniX	yea, mate is lighter than KDE
2016-01-03 02:49:56	nenis43	Well I was going to 'upgrade' my Ubuntu MATE to Ubuntu GNOME and then I was told that SUSE is a native GNOME distro.
2016-01-03 02:50:24	nenis43	I'll stick to Ubuntu MATE.
2016-01-03 02:50:25	CygniX	AlbertoP: even at that, I still can comprehend forcing a parent to pay for cost associated with college
2016-01-03 02:50:34	CygniX	s/can/cant'
2016-01-03 02:50:36	CygniX	t
2016-01-03 02:50:45	AlbertoP	uhm I do
2016-01-03 02:51:09	nenis43	Cygnix, It's slavery no doubt, but you can opt out by leaving the country.
2016-01-03 02:51:13	CygniX	nenis43: SUSE yes is a native GNOME OS
2016-01-03 02:51:28	AlbertoP	uhm?
2016-01-03 02:51:28	CygniX	openSUSE however, is a native KDE OS
2016-01-03 02:51:31	AlbertoP	slavery?
2016-01-03 02:51:48	⚡	AlbertoP is a bit confused :)
2016-01-03 02:52:14	nenis43	You mean they're not the same thing?
2016-01-03 02:52:18	AlbertoP	CygniX, actually people are effectively taking money back when doing that, since they paid in advance with taxes ;)
2016-01-03 02:52:19	nenis43	I'm in the KDE channel?
2016-01-03 02:52:24	CygniX	AlbertoP: I think nenis43 meant the forced payment of cost associated with college
2016-01-03 02:52:38	CygniX	nenis43: no
2016-01-03 02:52:43	nenis43	Being forced to do anything is a trait of slavery.
2016-01-03 02:52:50	CygniX	this the  suse offtopic channel
2016-01-03 02:52:54	AlbertoP	CygniX, well it's "forced" only if the kid "deserves it". That's the language...
2016-01-03 02:53:12	AlbertoP	if he/she is lazy or doesn't go well, doesn't work that way

2016-01-03 02:53:53	AlbertoP	slave? :)
2016-01-03 02:53:57	nenis43	That's still slavery. It's selecting the best and the brightest and enslaving them.
2016-01-03 02:54:03	AlbertoP	you clearly never saw Italian kids LOL
2016-01-03 02:54:18	AlbertoP	nenis43, they don't *have to* study
2016-01-03 02:54:27	AlbertoP	lol you didn't follow from the beginning
2016-01-03 02:54:47	CygniX	I hope am not passing out bad information to nenis43 about default DE on SUSE and openSUSE
2016-01-03 02:54:56	CygniX	someone please correct me if am wronge
2016-01-03 02:54:58	AlbertoP	CygniX, no idea, I just use KDE
2016-01-03 02:57:42	AlbertoP	CygniX, the executive order on guns made it on the .it news :)
2016-01-03 02:58:11	AlbertoP	quoting "Tired of the lack of action of Congress, the President decided to move forward... bla bla"
2016-01-03 02:58:25	CygniX	It might be an executive action and not order. there is a slight difference
2016-01-03 02:58:47	CygniX	but, we shall wait
2016-01-03 02:59:56	AlbertoP	also Trump made it
2016-01-03 02:59:57	AlbertoP	:P
2016-01-03 03:00:27	AlbertoP	apparently West Virginia is where he is stronger...
2016-01-03 03:00:42	CygniX	Trump?
2016-01-03 03:00:48	CygniX	Not surprised
2016-01-03 03:01:25	CygniX	West Virginia is one of the armpits of U.S.
2016-01-03 03:01:31	AlbertoP	followed by NY, Long Island, North Carolina, Alabama, Missisipi, Tenessee, Lousiana, South Carolina
2016-01-03 03:01:58	AlbertoP	surprised about NY
2016-01-03 03:02:14	CygniX	He is from that area so that is normal
