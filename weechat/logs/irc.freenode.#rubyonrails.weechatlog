2016-01-10 20:42:48	stevenxl	Hi everyone.
2016-01-10 20:42:53	YankNYC	does anyone think there would be a problem with sing the same model twice for two different has_and_belongs_to_many relationship?
2016-01-10 20:43:01	YankNYC	sing - using
2016-01-10 20:43:11	stevenxl	is jsonbuilder the go-to gem for building out a json, or is there some alternative that is more popular?
2016-01-10 20:43:28	YankNYC	the join tables are different so that should be fine but I'm just wondering about any other concerns?
2016-01-10 20:44:26	gheegh	YankNYC: shouldn't be a problem, if the data doesn't conflict.

2016-01-10 21:09:10	sharkman	, when i run it inside postges it returns a single float

2016-01-10 23:02:42	sharkman	oh yeah its easy within just sql

2016-01-10 23:02:47	sharkman	i wanted to use part sql part RoR
2016-01-10 23:02:52	chridal	sql = "SQL here"; ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(sql)
2016-01-10 23:03:02	sharkman	i figured a hybrid would be best here
2016-01-10 23:04:43	sharkman	i can just tag this on to it, .map {|game| game.away_score + game.home_score }
2016-01-10 23:04:47	sharkman	but isnt it faster to do in sql?
2016-01-10 23:04:54	ℹ	elaptics is now known as elaptics`away
2016-01-10 23:05:46	chridal	Well it's a very different thing to do it in SQL because then you can use it to order results etc. I don;t know what else you need to do with it.
2016-01-10 23:05:53	rhizome	what does "away_score + home_score" mean? i've never heard of that as a criteria for anything

2016-01-11 21:11:15	bronson	Yep.
2016-01-11 21:11:50	bronson	they intentionally don't spin up controllers, they expect us to stub any helpers in the test.
2016-01-11 21:11:59	tubbo	bronson: well, it might be true...but the error you posted in gist indicates that an error occurred in the helper, not the test. you are NOT trying to call a helper method in your test case...
2016-01-11 21:12:01	bronson	which is OK but they also don't tell us how to stub and keep breaking it.  :)
2016-01-11 21:12:21	tubbo	so i'm not sure how the rspec-rails issue is relevant to the problem you described in the gist
2016-01-11 21:12:26	Radar	bronson: Does anything change if you put the helper_method after the methods themselves?
2016-01-11 21:12:46	bronson	no, you're right...   the test renders the view, the template calls SearchHelper helper, and those helpers eventually call an ApplicationController helper.
2016-01-11 21:12:59	Radar	Actually, looks like this is a view test.
2016-01-11 21:13:00	bronson	everything works until they can't find the ApplcationController helper.
2016-01-11 21:13:05	Radar	bronson: where is the test itself?

2016-01-11 21:14:03	bronson	I think it's the only view test in my entire app.

2016-01-11 21:14:44	smathy	bronson, as suggested use a controller spec with view rendering switched on instead.
2016-01-11 21:15:01	Radar	bronson: Show us the test.

2016-01-12 22:45:13	mrgreenfur	Anyone know some rails conventions for where to put async code? I have sidekiq running jobs via activejob, but i’m not so sure where to put complex code. For example, I’m making api calls to lots of services, should I make a controller or a model to contain each logic?
2016-01-12 22:45:14	kb3ien	Not sure where we're going wrong after the update, but the browser shows an error Sass::Syntax Error , view src shows the normal page. no sign of the error string.
2016-01-12 22:46:00	tubbo	mrgreenfur: i typically use service objects for delegating complex functionality. especially when i integrate with outside services.
2016-01-12 22:46:38	skullcrasher	is there an alternative gem for sprockets and its asset pipline?
2016-01-12 22:46:50	mrgreenfur	tubbo: thanks for the help! what is a service object? In my other async jobs i call model methods to do the real work.

2016-01-12 23:47:59	bronson	ah, write ActionCable code in CS but don't require the compiler.  That sounds reasonable.
2016-01-12 23:48:20	bronson	Is Redis a permanent part of Rails now?   (as much as ActiveRecord anyway)
2016-01-12 23:48:44	michael_mbp	it shouldn't be.  ActiveJob should let you pick your backend last I checked.
2016-01-12 23:48:59	bronson	the dep is from ActionCable
2016-01-12 23:49:03	michael_mbp	unless redis is now some default cachestore.
2016-01-12 23:49:16	matthewd	Not necessarily. If we end up with a second viable ACa backend, it can be optional.
2016-01-12 23:49:22	michael_mbp	ah, was thinking of any other reason for having it as a dep apart from AC.

2016-01-12 23:51:26	bronson	It's funny, I had the opposite experience: I don't mind CS sitting there doing nothing, but I really mind needing to fulfill Redis dependencies on my deploy host.
2016-01-12 23:51:57	bronson	True that most projects are using Redis these days...  If Rails makes it mandatory, I'll go along with it.

2016-01-13 22:13:51	choke	i can agree with that tubbo
2016-01-13 22:13:52	tubbo	the language itself still needs a lot of work, but there has been really good developments. unfortunately, PHP is still written by PHP developers
2016-01-13 22:13:57	tubbo	so they won't take advantage of all that
2016-01-13 22:14:04	tubbo	instead just preferring to encapsulate all the pages in a big switch statement
2016-01-13 22:14:37	choke	I think honestly for PHP to be viable again, they'd have to completely overhaul the OOP aspect of it -- the after-thought bolt-on just doesn't do it for me anymore
2016-01-13 22:15:58	tubbo	choke: or better yet, just rip it out completely.
2016-01-13 22:16:01	choke	though even if they did that, i don't think i'd go back to writing php unless i absolutely had to...  i'm liking my ruby/rails ( less than a year knowing them )
2016-01-13 22:16:18	tubbo	php isn't good at object oriented programming, the sooner they realize and come to terms with that, the better.

2016-01-13 22:20:26	tubbo	if you want to compete with a service, the self-hosted solution *needs* to be just as easy to set up...so a 1-click install.

2016-01-13 22:20:58	tubbo	thankfully, heroku was around to sponsor us and we got into the first beta of the 1-click heroku installs

2016-01-13 23:26:09	mustmodify	I have a screen where someone is paying for a subscription... subscriptions#new. They can pay by check or CC. Subscription#payment is polymorphic. But it turns out you can't pass in payment_type and payment_attributes, which I guess makes sense. So do I build the appropriate type of payment first and then set the attributes? Or do I create two controllers... CardPaymentsController and CheckPaymentsController ?
2016-01-13 23:26:21	user083	tfitts: I will try that

How do I make it such that when you create a room you must specify the building it belongs to, and whenever you're editing a building you can also add rooms?
