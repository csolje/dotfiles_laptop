2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[13:40:15] andering: that's why i test and try other distros in a VM
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[13:40:25] mingdao: H is for hard links
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ss_	[13:40:26] t
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:40:42] rx80: that too, which is why I'm not trying to guide dragonreborn out of this mess ;)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[13:41:03] ye.... better use a proper backup tool
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:41:20] mingdao: i have followed gentoo and arch wiki
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:41:30] used -av or -aAv
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Dreg_Master	[13:41:31] Andering - thanks for that. that why i wanted to learn gentoo
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:41:34] rx80: for me, and maybe just for me, rsync is great for daily backup of ~/ and such, but not for OS
2016-01-16 15:16:47	andering	[13:41:36] rx80: i think when i was switching, reason was to save time by having system not as much customizable, but i don't think it made any change. Better is keep things simple.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[13:41:50] mingdao: i agree :) rsync for home
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:42:06] interesting
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:42:24] since i could boot in to the restored system at least to bash,
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:42:28] dragonreborn: what distro is this?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:42:40] i have over-rsync-ed the restored file from the live system
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:42:47] and permission errors are gone
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[13:42:48] andering: it takes a while to get used to gentoo, but i find it's quite easy to stay up to date, if you are into linux... if you don't want to bother with details, gentoo is not for you
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:42:52] gentoo naturally
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Dreg_Master	[13:43:07] Im gonna need continue this tomorrow. Thank for the help dudes :P (Tomorrow goal is to install Gentoo onto HDD)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[13:43:23] Dreg_Master: see you tomorrow then
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:44:36] it would be ncie to be able to recover from a live usb
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:45:09] dragonreborn: did you follow this guide explicitly? https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/A_simple_backup_scheme_using_rsnapshot
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:45:20] yep
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:45:51] cant rly get it why
2016-01-16 15:16:47	thereh	[13:46:07] gen2
2016-01-16 15:16:47	thereh	[13:46:27] I mean you can read gentoo as gen2
2016-01-16 15:16:47	thereh	[13:46:45] or gentwo
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:47:15] dragonreborn: you wrote "i have followed gentoo and arch wiki" ... maybe mixed instructions?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:47:40] dragonreborn: you should check /root/.bash_history and see if your commands were correct
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:48:25] after i failed with the -a flag what gentoo suggested
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:48:38] i tried the -aAv what arch suggested, still..
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:50:58] dragonreborn: that -a switch only in the Gentoo wiki makes me uncomfortable
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:51:08] archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:51:34] it looked somewhat few to me as well
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:51:35] dragonreborn: is the OS and backup mounted on the exact same filesystem type?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:51:41] yes
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:52:24] should i need extended attributes as well?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:52:35] iamben: are you there?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:52:38] dragonreborn: -a has no perms, no attributes, no hard links followed
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:52:48] humm
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:52:48] just smells like a recipe for failure to me
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:52:56] you r prolly right
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:53:04] again, I shouldn't even comment; never used rsnapshot
2016-01-16 15:16:47	guest1235	[13:53:46] Hello, does someone know if I can install a version of a package that's not on the server anymore?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	guest1235	[13:53:57] in my case, I need 12.5 of https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/games-board/pioneers
2016-01-16 15:16:47	guest1235	[13:54:16] and I'd like to avoid installing it manually
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:55:22] mingdao: almost every places on the net they suggest only -av
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:55:23] dragonreborn: first thing you mentioned as your problem was "have weird permission problems" ... and that article only says use -a, without -A (acls, perms)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:55:29] thats not muc
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:55:42] i know iamben uses rsnapshot for backup, maybe he`ll know whats up
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:55:48] dragonreborn: yay ... sorry, I can't help you
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:56:04] mingdao: thanks a lot still!
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mingdao	[13:56:06] when he comes around today he probably can
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+Fieldy	[13:56:32] for backups of all types i use an rsync server set up with modules per-backup (generally per system or content type), then every few hours a script is run on each source to sync things up on the server
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+Fieldy	[13:56:45] if i want incrimentals, rdiff-backup is where it's at, though that can be quite slow
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+Fieldy	[13:57:07] "server" is best on a NAS or something else with highly redundant storage
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+Fieldy	[13:57:27] then you can back up that one "system" and back up everything to somewhere off site / offline disks whate er
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:57:34] well probelm isnt with the made backups, than with the restoration
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:57:50] i recall i had same problem with rsync made backups earlier
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[13:58:06] prolly i mess up something but i seem to be unable to restore the files with right permissions
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+Fieldy	[13:59:05] never had issues with that here
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+Fieldy	[13:59:24] clearly it's important to practice once in a while, verify that it'll all work (outside of a real need) so you can figure out what's wrong
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[14:00:52] guest1235: have you tried looking at overlays?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[14:01:02] guest1235: or creating your own ebuild?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[14:01:22] guest1235: 1st option is very easy, 2nd easy, but a bit more involved
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Guest65428	[14:01:32] I use rsnapshot too, but I never tried restoring it. Maybe I have reason to be worried too, although all the permissions are perfectly intact in my backups.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	guest1235	[14:02:09] rx80: thanks, I'll try looking at overlays
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[14:02:30] guest1235: http://gpo.zugaina.org/
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[14:02:36] that seems to be yet another thing which works to others but not for me :D
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[14:02:47] no idea what i screw up
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dragonreborn	[14:03:21] but then again booting up the restored system to bash and doing another restore from there seem to fixed the permissons
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[14:03:22] guest1235: seems there are no old ebuilds.... next easiest thing: make a local overlay, copy over the ebuild, change the version.... emerge
2016-01-16 15:16:47	andering	[14:09:34] guest1235: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Overlay/Local_overlay
2016-01-16 15:16:47	andering	[14:12:42] guest1235: lol i know that board game, We call it Osadníci z Katanu :), i didn't know someone made app :),why do you want older version ?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	guest1235	[14:13:47] andering: compatibility to someone who has only the older version...
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Guest65428	[14:17:57] guest1235: Can't you just install it manually in some directory and then launch it from there?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	guest1235	[14:18:19] Guest65428: No, impossible.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Guest65428	[14:18:28] Why?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	guest1235	[14:18:29] But the problem is solved, thanks anyways ;)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	andering	[14:18:36] guest1235: make it as rx80 said.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	guest1235	[14:18:39] wants to load stuff from usr local
2016-01-16 15:16:47	andering	[14:19:01] guest1235: :)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Guest65428	[14:20:15] Okay.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[14:21:15] andering: settlers of catan
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Josef__K	[14:27:31] Gahh, I'm getting this "Check that kernel supports aes-xts-plain cipher (check syslog for more info)." error from cryptsetup, but I cannot figure out why.  All the relevant kernel options appear enabled.  Help??
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Josef__K	[14:28:12] This is only the second time I've used cryptsetup, so I'm not that experienced with it.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	rx80	[14:30:32] guest1235: why can't your friend download the newest version? :D
2016-01-16 15:16:47	guest1235	[14:30:47] rx80: stupid openSuSE :P
2016-01-16 15:16:47	guest1235	[14:31:02] the reason why I switched... only old packages
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Guest65428	[14:31:22] Josef__K: What does the log have to say?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Josef__K	[14:31:47] > device-mapper: 254:0: crypt: Device lookup failed
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Josef__K	[14:32:07] > device-mapper: ioctl: error adding target to table
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Josef__K	[14:35:54] I have already formatted the partition as ext4 -- do I need to change the partition type or wipe it or something?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	andering	[14:43:24] Josef__K: can you show your kernel .config please ? :)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Josef__K	[14:43:57] It's a little tricky since it's on another machine.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Josef__K	[14:47:41] But the relevant config options are enabled when I browse them via 'less /proc/config.gz', such as BLK_DEV_DM, DM_CRYPT, CRYPTO_XTS and CRYPTO_AES.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Josef__K	[14:55:12] Oh god, the embarrassment. The partition was mounted. Not very helpful error messages.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	andering	[14:59:44] Josef__K: ?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Josef__K	[15:00:49] The partition I was trying to encrypt was already mounted as its regular filesystem, so I couldn't do anything to it until I unmounted it.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	andering	[15:00:59] i see. :)

2016-01-16 17:54:33	wonko7	[17:45:26] you can usually specify the path as a env variable
2016-01-16 17:54:33	username234	[17:45:31] m_ben: in any case the only way to know what the real problem is would be to look at the config.log
2016-01-16 17:54:33	petan	[17:46:03] username234: what is difference between world and  @world
2016-01-16 17:54:33	m_ben	[17:46:04] username234, wonko7: I emerged from portage, the problem is that portage provides only the binary valigen-0.28, so I added a symlink called valigen, but that doesn't seem to work
2016-01-16 17:54:33	username234	[17:46:40] petan: 'world' is the older (possibly deprecated) syntax.
2016-01-16 17:54:33	wonko7	[17:46:59] m_ben: what did you symlink? a binary in /usr/bin?
2016-01-16 17:54:33	m_ben	[17:47:22] wonko7: in /usr/bin I did: ln valigen-0.28 valigen
2016-01-16 17:54:33	wonko7	[17:47:37] and username234 is right, you'll get more answers from a config.log
2016-01-16 17:54:33	m_ben	[17:47:40] wonko7: why isn't that provided by the package in the first place?
2016-01-16 17:54:33	m_ben	[17:48:35] I meant vapigen and not valigen
2016-01-16 17:54:33	m_ben	[17:49:14] username234, wonko7: yes, vapigen is not found in the pkg-config search path
2016-01-16 17:54:33	username234	[17:50:02] m_ben "...but when I configure a project" what project?
2016-01-16 17:54:33	username234	[17:50:36] m_ben: and is that project coming from portage or are you trying to build that project from source?
2016-01-16 17:54:33	bezerker	[17:50:54] wonko7: no errors that i see.. bout to grab a boot cd and fsck etc
2016-01-16 17:54:33	m_ben	[17:51:22] username234: this terminal here: https://github.com/thestinger/termite or actually not even that, yet, because it depends on another lib: https://github.com/thestinger/vte-ng and that one gives me the error
2016-01-16 17:54:33	m_ben	[17:51:37] username234: yes from source because not available in portage yet
2016-01-16 17:54:33	wonko7	[17:51:41] m_ben: it's got the version number because it is slotted, so you can install multible versions
2016-01-16 17:54:33	username234	[17:52:04] which suggests there's probably an eselect package for vala.
2016-01-16 17:54:33	bezerker	[17:52:19] oh, it is interesting that openrc was one of the updated packages
2016-01-16 17:54:33	bezerker	[17:52:21] hrm
2016-01-16 17:54:33	username234	[17:52:34] or not :)
2016-01-16 17:54:33	m_ben	[17:52:41] username234: :(
2016-01-16 17:54:33	username234	[17:53:04] m_ben: which mean that creating the symlink was the wrong approach.  Lets' see the config log for vte-ng
2016-01-16 17:54:33	wonko7	[17:53:04] and it does install pkg config files in both /usr/share/pkgconfig & /usr/lib64/pkgconfig
2016-01-16 17:54:33	bezerker	[17:53:38] there also appears to be a newer openrc package avail
2016-01-16 17:54:33	wonko7	[17:53:40] bezerker: you could always downgrade to try
2016-01-16 17:54:33	bezerker	[17:54:04] wonko7: can't run emerge because of missing dev, so have to see if i can chroot in to try to fix that
2016-01-16 17:54:33	wonko7	[17:54:09] or upgrade if you're feeling lucky :)
2016-01-16 17:54:33	wonko7	[17:54:15] oh that sucks

2016-01-16 17:55:59	wonko7	I snapshot a few times a week, if something breaks at least I've got a usable snapshot so I can still get some work done
2016-01-16 17:56:31	bezerker	yea, a very good idea
