When I try to run a plot with seaborn, I call the first row header. Seaborn seems to read the 2nd row header and doesn't know what to do with it. How can I get seaborn to read rows 1 and 2 as the column header or just skip the 2nd header row altogether?

2015-11-08 12:17:43	skfax	I'm creating an Android app which accepts pickled files as input to describe a model used by the app. However the pickled files can be compressed by more than 50% if zipped. Is it kosher to use "gzip.GzipFile('model.pklz', 'wb')" and dump the pickle output directly in zipped form? Or should I create a "proper zip file" with a distinct file inside it which contains the model. There will always be 1 model per zip file.

2015-11-08 13:00:43	sidni	what i am trying to do is return a count of how many of the items in the list are also keys in the dictionary.
2015-11-08 13:01:07	sidni	the list are basically keys
2015-11-08 13:01:07	Yhg1s	sidni: iterate over the items in the list, use 'in' to test if they are keys in the dict.

2016-01-03 02:03:46	_habnabit	bahoo, did you install fabric into the virtualenv?
2016-01-03 02:03:46	bahoo	`which fab` and `which python` both point to the same bin folder..

2016-01-11 21:06:24	foormea	hello! i have very basic skills in python. i have a raspberry pi and i'm getting some accessories for it (relay and temperature sensors). i'd like to turn on some sockets for say 5mn every 30mn ; i'd also like to turn on some other sockets if temperature is below X degrees. i have done a bit of research and it seems like i should use the "multiprocessing" lib, and the "apscheduler". will that be the right direction for me to go?

2016-01-11 21:20:28	nevinevi	jwhisnant basically it looks as if I use a QThread for a processor-intensive operation, the operation is blocking, whereas if I use the python built-in threading module, it correctly runs in background

This program used to be Python 2.7 with PyQt4 and PyOpenGl, but now it's Python 3.4, PyQt5 and PyOpenGL 3.0.1. Based on my print statements, where the house clicks is correct, the objects load corectly, but when you select an object it just selects the first entry in the file, rather than the entry that you click on. It always

What I do is mainly creating two channels via chan1, chan2 = Pipe() and then Process(target=f, args=(chan2,)).  function f performs some chan2.send(...) operations
