2016-01-16 15:16:46	arup_r	[08:40:06] dopie: most stable solution when you too selenium .. is `wait` like justin has shown here, http://stackoverflow.com/a/15953186 so use that instead of sleep
2016-01-16 15:16:46	arup_r	[08:40:15] s/too/use
2016-01-16 15:16:46	arup_r	[08:40:46] sleep works, but wait.untill {} is the standard one
2016-01-16 15:16:46	arup_r	[08:41:06] selenium will wait till your element is visible on the page..
2016-01-16 15:16:46	arup_r	[08:41:22] then once it sees, it will take an action

2016-01-16 15:16:46	Giorgio	[10:35:32] Hello, How to add from engine nested routes under resource.
2016-01-16 15:16:46	fox_mulder_cp	[10:36:27] Giorgio: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html ??
2016-01-16 15:16:46	Giorgio	[10:36:50] https://gist.github.com/tapalilov/611c162397bafabf64fe ive tried that way but override custom routes from other engine
2016-01-16 15:16:46	Giorgio	[10:38:39] fox_mulder_cp, i want to add nested resource under resource defined by another egnine
2016-01-16 15:16:46	fox_mulder_cp	[10:52:04] Giorgio: i see no problems in this code. but i'm not a profi in rails...
2016-01-16 15:16:46	acosonic	[10:52:20] Hi all, what would be the proper way to draw MVC scheme, this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/marcric/ror3gangsclock/general_mvc.png or this http://www.bogotobogo.com/RubyOnRails/images/MVC/MVC_Rails.png the difference is view->browser or controller->browser ...
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[10:54:00] the first one.
2016-01-16 15:16:46	acosonic	[10:59:22] so, controller->browser... But you are reffering to AppController not the some controller within the app...
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[10:59:38] no, any controller.
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:01:59] i want to unlink a child record (belongs_to) from its parent (has_one) without deleting either record. how do i do this?
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:02:31] unset the foreign key
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:02:36] i tried to set the foreign key on the child record to nil or '', but nothing happened
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:03:04] or just set the association to ni
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:03:05] l
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:03:09] the foreign key value remained unchanged
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:03:23] !debug

2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:05:37] sevenseacat, instead of giving half-written code lemme try to explain better what i wanna do. i have a Profile records that belong_to one Place record. in the Profile edit form, i wanna add a checkbox that deletes the foreign key/relationship with its Place
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:06:06] thats fine, but that doesnt change how to do it.
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:06:28] i tried something in profiles_controller like: if :checkbox == 0, @profile.place_id = nil
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:06:37] but it didn't work
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:06:39] !debug

2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:07:03] :checkbox will never == 0.
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:07:08] a symbol is not an integer.
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:07:17] sorry i meant == 1
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:07:31] it will never == 1 either. a symbol is not an integer.
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:08:09] so params[:checkbox] == 1 does't work either?
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:08:20] kitsuneyo: last chance to provide some code.
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:08:32] fine gimme a second sevenseacat
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:08:57] gee thanks, you make it sound like you're doing me a favour
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:10:45] https://gist.github.com/kitsuneyo/dcdaf6398471bc8f9ded
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:11:07] params[:remove_place] is nil
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:11:08] sevenseacat, i know you love helping me out so much i figured...
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:11:18] kitsuneyo: i wouldnt push it.
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:11:30] i'm just kidding, lighten up
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:11:47] i really appreciate your help
2016-01-16 15:16:46	sevenseacat	[11:11:54] again, who is doing who the favour here?
2016-01-16 15:16:46	kitsuneyo	[11:12:03] you!
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:12:38] why is params[:remove_place] nil?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[11:12:51] because you're not submitting a value for it
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:13:20] oh
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:13:28] i think i see why i messed this up now
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:14:48] lemme check what development log saya
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:14:49] says
2016-01-16 15:16:47	acosonic	[11:16:39] sevenseacat: hm, ok...
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:19:17] sevenseacat: i added the patch params from development.log here https://gist.github.com/kitsuneyo/dcdaf6398471bc8f9ded
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:19:33] there is a value there but i guess i'm not accessing it correctly?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[11:19:58] i know what the params look like, i saw them in your strong parameters call
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[11:20:04] compare the two
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:21:02] you don't because i don't think :remove_place really belongs in that strong_params call
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:21:25] after all remove_place isn't part of the profile model
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:21:41] the checkbox is just <%= check_box_tag :remove_place %>
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[11:22:21] so where exactly is remove_place in your params?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:27:17] it's outside the user_profile hash
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[11:27:44] not in the params you posted
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:27:45] so i guess not being in strong params it's being ignored?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[11:28:07] are we looking at the same params and code?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[11:28:26] "not being in strong params" (yes it is) "but being in my actual params" (no its not)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:28:46] sorry, it's there now
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[11:29:28] kitsuneyo: i'd rather not waste any more time on this. please put together one gist with the code, logs, and any related information.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:30:32] nevermind, don't wanna waste your time. thanks anyway.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[11:31:36] suit yourself.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	kitsuneyo	[11:48:51] sevenseacat, i guess you gave me the answer when you said a symbol is not an integer. when i changed the code to == '1' instead of == 1, it worked
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[11:49:02] :)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	arup_r	[13:14:42] hi sevenseacat .. how are you ?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[13:14:49] arup_r: evening
2016-01-16 15:16:47	arup_r	[13:15:32] You again beat us :(
2016-01-16 15:16:47	arup_r	[13:16:04] I mean in Cricket.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	znow	[13:16:20] Im starring blind at a feature I need to implement in a html table, showing data with specific rows being injected if previous row is positive and next row is negative. I have an excel spreadsheet showing the correct example - i've worked with take_while and drop_while - all though getting more confused. Im willing to pay for the time.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	gavit	[13:16:48] moin
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[13:16:49] arup_r: we're good at that ;)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	arup_r	[13:16:58] I agree sevenseacat
2016-01-16 15:16:47	fox_mulder_cp	[14:14:44] hm. generate rails new app, add devise and puma, start app in production mode and see 'devise config.secret_key not defined', but in config see that it use rails env secret_key_base from os
2016-01-16 15:16:47	fox_mulder_cp	[14:15:54] wants to hardcode secret key at config (
2016-01-16 15:16:47	fox_mulder_cp	[14:17:30] config.secret_key = env['secret_key_base'] not work in devise initializer (
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[14:17:36] sure it works.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	fox_mulder_cp	[14:18:26] hm. give me your sure )
2016-01-16 15:16:47	fox_mulder_cp	[14:18:45] in other my apps i see that this key hardcoded
2016-01-16 15:16:47	fox_mulder_cp	[14:25:29] hm. really, how to move devise.config.secret_key to environment, and why it don't use already prepared base key, rails see this key and use it..
2016-01-16 15:16:47	sevenseacat	[14:26:09] did you actually set the env variable?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	fox_mulder_cp	[14:28:02] yes...
2016-01-16 15:16:47	adaedra	[14:29:03] did you export it?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	fox_mulder_cp	[14:29:06] hm. this keys must me set BEFORE rake asset precompile...
2016-01-16 15:16:47	fox_mulder_cp	[14:29:33] and before app starts

2016-01-16 18:08:11	arup_r	In my current organization, I got a feature. and I have completed also. but there are 2 buttons.. They asked me make the currently active button also highlighted and the other one blur.. I tried, but my CSS power couldn't break their CSS *specificity* .. and I raised my hand finally and told them, this is not my food, give it to someone who can enjoy..
2016-01-16 18:08:16	arup_r	:sigh:

2016-01-16 18:10:02	Andr3as	it did not accept the key in there (for unknown reasons)
