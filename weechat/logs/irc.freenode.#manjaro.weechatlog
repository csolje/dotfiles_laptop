2016-01-07 22:24:12	mike-zal	there are two ways of doing that. installing manjaro in uefi mode or install grub for uefi mode from live version
2016-01-07 22:24:16	silverbrit_	like a banner
2016-01-07 22:24:39	+xstefen	Shit man, im not familiar with UEFI boot setups
2016-01-07 22:24:43	mike-zal	frankly, installing system anew is quickler and easier then installing boot if you are newbie
2016-01-07 22:24:44	+xstefen	mike-zal seems to have an idea
2016-01-07 22:25:01	silverbrit_	mike-zal: Reinstalling manjaro?
2016-01-07 22:25:04	mike-zal	yes, because I was struggling with the same problem
2016-01-07 22:25:05	+xstefen	My solution would work in any other bios situation
2016-01-07 22:25:23	silverbrit_	I should keep the windows ssd in when I reinstall manjaro, right?
2016-01-07 22:25:28	+xstefen	yes
2016-01-07 22:25:30	mike-zal	silverbrit_: in order to install manjaro in uefi, you need to create uefi bootable usb
2016-01-07 22:25:44	silverbrit_	I have a bootable usb for manjaro already.
2016-01-07 22:26:04	silverbrit_	so just boot to that and clear the partition and install like new?

2016-01-07 22:26:09	mike-zal	this can be done either by dd command or from image writer. if you are creating live usb in windows, use rufus

2016-01-07 22:27:28	+xstefen	Dont overwrite windows partition :)
2016-01-07 22:27:44	silverbrit_	Yeah, I've see two options for like 'UEFI: usb 2.0 [name]' and like USB 2.0

2016-01-07 22:28:08	+xstefen	the one without UEFI is for standard BIOS boot mode which I prefer

2016-01-07 22:29:38	mike-zal	silverbrit_:  when you will be on manjaro live, use this command above to check if you are really in uefi mode. if so, use calamaries installer. mount  /boot/efi partition
2016-01-07 22:29:58	silverbrit_	and then install to the hardrive?
2016-01-07 22:30:21	silverbrit_	What option should I do, last time I installed to entire hardrive
2016-01-07 22:30:59	silverbrit_	I'll boot into the uefi live usb on manjaro and use that command and connect to irc before I use calmaries.
2016-01-07 22:31:04	mike-zal	if you are in live uefi and mount properly /boot/efi then you should install manjaro in uefi mode. grub should start and recognize also windows
2016-01-07 22:32:01	mike-zal	well, you can create seperate partition for /boot/efi
2016-01-07 22:32:20	silverbrit_	alright, going to do it and we can walk through the installer.
2016-01-07 22:32:41	mike-zal	it's possible to use windows uefi partition, but I'm not sure how safe it is. never tried it myself.
2016-01-07 22:33:17	mike-zal	the safest way is to use another efi partition.

2016-01-07 22:53:27	mike-zal	uefi install is tricky. not sure if automatic install does efi. from what I saw it does but for learning purposes it's better to do it manually. if that won't work, he can always repeat this steps and do automatic install.

2016-01-09 22:08:04	PMunch	mike-zal2, that is true. But let's pretend my disk crashed. Zero chance of recovery. Caught fire and dropped out of a plane into the ocean. What I want is to be able to get a new drive, then boot from a LiveCD and restore from my backup. Afterwards simply boot back into my system as if nothing happened.
2016-01-09 22:08:34	@ringo32	LyriCa  what do you mean with map it ?
2016-01-09 22:08:40	PMunch	ringo32, I have a couple of those as well. But that won't help much if my house catches fire..

2016-01-09 22:11:15	mike-zal2	PMunch: I wished that too. but last times when I restored only /home it restored all my personal files, all programs settings (so after install) they just used it, whole desktop setting. it was pretty much to a full system restore. I just missed few aps but that was few clicks away.
2016-01-09 22:11:23	LyriCa	ringo32 no its not that one

2016-01-09 22:12:32	mike-zal2	PMunch: even when I run spotify I was logged in and it was paused on the same song in the same second I left it... so that is pretty impressive as for new system install

2016-01-09 22:13:23	mike-zal2	but to ensure for even better backup, I included usr folder. I would like also to know what to save to get all aps. it would be increadible,
2016-01-09 22:13:38	PMunch	Which I'm not quite sure I agree with.. I feel like user files and program settings should be separated.

2016-01-09 22:18:47	PMunch	Now that I think about it most configs usually have multiple possible locations. /home being only one of them..
2016-01-09 22:19:29	PMunch	Of course it would be possible to have symlinks to a sort of local home folder which was present on all devices. But that is a bit of a hackey solution..

2016-01-09 22:22:59	PMunch	Sharing anything but /home would be pretty crazy..
2016-01-09 22:23:17	PMunch	mike-zal2, what do you mean?
2016-01-09 22:23:43	mike-zal2	never tired that but I think I saw somewhere an option to set personalized download directory path. or maybe I'm wrong
2016-01-09 22:24:20	mike-zal2	so basically you could link downloads, music and others to another, shared location but leave the rest
2016-01-09 22:24:29	PMunch	That is true
2016-01-09 22:24:53	PMunch	You could simply symlink those folders to something which was shared.
2016-01-09 22:25:01	PMunch	Hmm, that might actually be a good idea..
2016-01-09 22:25:28	mike-zal2	I thinks so too :)
2016-01-09 22:25:43	mike-zal2	think*
2016-01-09 22:26:35	mike-zal2	anyway, I don't need it for now, since all my hdd is used for manjaro, but let us know if it works for you.

I do understand the concerns but in reality there is litterally zero influence on my life. I have better things to do then be mad things that are out of my contro. there are those who care and those will fight.

2016-01-10 23:37:04	RebelCoder	Guys, what is the best (fastest way) to remove unwanted software ? I mean I just installed fresh Manjaro, but 90% of software that comes with it - I don't need. Removing per-package is very slow and some of the packages, I am unclear if I am removing the right application
2016-01-10 23:37:34	RebelCoder	Just want to remove apps and be sure, that I am removing those exact apps.
2016-01-10 23:37:57	RebelCoder	Like QT stuff that comes with it, it is unclear what to remove as there are tons of QT packages installed.

2016-01-11 00:46:56	Teo__	Hi I would like to know why: on manjaro xfce x64 when had opened 4 differnet chatroom in firefox on java only and my laptop thinkpad T61 with 2,4 Ghz core 2 duo and 4GB and my cpu and and memory always was in 99-100%, but when opened this the same chat on linux mint xfce x 64 live cd in firefox ... cpu is 20% and mem 15% and computer is not hot? 
2016-01-11 00:47:47	Teo__	I had upgrated manjaro , mint is on live cd ... now im on this live cd and computer have less usage of cpu and mem than manjaro... why?
2016-01-11 00:49:01	mike-zal	Teo__: maybe your hardware is not compatible with arch systems? I have the opposite situation. my laptop heats up on all debian/ubuntu based systems but runs well on arch based ones

2016-01-11 00:53:50	mike-zal	Teo__: every computer is different, even the same model. individual hardware parts like processor or gpu sometimes may work differently
2016-01-11 00:54:00	Teo__	mike-zal: but as i said ... on livecd mint my laptop is less usage of cpu mem and temparure thah manjaro xfce... :/ to bad becouse I like manjaro
2016-01-11 00:54:48	mike-zal	that is why some may overclock the same processor more, some may not

Monitors are now clones but internal monitor (1376x768) only shows part of desktop. When I try to access Monitor/layout settings from the Settingspanel the settingspanel just flickers and nothing else. How do I enable Monitor/layout settings?

2016-01-12 21:08:26	+dodgejcr	lol no problem all I did was google a little bit as I have never really played with xampp

2016-01-12 21:10:50	SovereignBleak	So I git cloned your community-packages repo to get thunderbird-kde but it's mildly annoying that I have to do this from your community-packages repo and not from the AUR. Why not encourage community relations by contributing those packages back to the AUR?
2016-01-12 21:11:00	+Strit_Laptop	Cool. So it will be a "limited" version. :)
2016-01-12 21:11:24	+Strit_Laptop	SovereignBleak, Why not just download the package from a mirror?
2016-01-12 21:11:25	+dodgejcr	Strit_Laptop: probably yeah since there wont be many other people with it
2016-01-12 21:11:44	SovereignBleak	Strit_Laptop: You mean your repos?
2016-01-12 21:12:12	+Strit_Laptop	SovereignBleak, My repo does not contain it, but all the manjaro mirrors have that package I believe.
2016-01-12 21:12:21	+dodgejcr	indeed it does
2016-01-12 21:12:28	+dodgejcr	in community, the same place as the PKGBUILD
2016-01-12 21:12:54	SovereignBleak	Strit_Laptop: I don't want to add Manjaro's repos to my pacman.conf at risk of incompatibility with my Arch packages.
2016-01-12 21:13:49	+Strit_Laptop	SovereignBleak, you can just download the package from a mirrors website and use pacman -U to install it.

2016-01-15 22:33:00	mike-zal	I looked for a extremly lightweight linux for my dad's laptop. tried puppy in VB and it was weird. Not sure if that was the VB issue but anyway Puppy was so foreign and I was too tired to focus on it so I moved on to Lubuntu. This time it was very pleasant experience. Easy, intuitive, extremly fast and not so bad at all.

2016-01-16 00:25:04	+magikfingerz	manjaro-web|4858, an expensive but flawless way to reduce boot times is to use an SSD... I have one and my boot time is 3-5 secs...
2016-01-16 00:25:07	+dodgejcr	21 seconds from boot to userspace seems decent for your specs. To reduce it a bit, you can kill off lightdm

2016-01-16 00:27:24	+magikfingerz	manjaro-web|4858, If you want a lower price you can buy a small SSD 80 or 120GB and use an external usb disk for all your files... I do that and works like a charm...

2016-01-16 00:31:04	+magikfingerz	manjaro-web|4858, in the worst case I think you will experiment a slighty decrease in speed, so, instead of boot on 3-5 secs, your PC could boot on 5-10 secs... :p
2016-01-16 00:31:39	+magikfingerz	manjaro-web|4858, even then.. you will gain a 50% speed...
