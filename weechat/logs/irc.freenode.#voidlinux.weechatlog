2015-11-29 18:52:29	fanderal	just installed Void and noticed Firefox won't install (missing harfbuzz) and Chromium won't work (missing a library)... will this be resolved soon?
2015-11-29 19:01:44	duncaen	fanderal: it definitly works
2015-11-29 19:03:20	fanderal	duncaen: other stuff (fluxbox, rox, leafpad, midori) installed without a problem
2015-11-29 19:03:43	duncaen	could you paste the command and the output you used to try to install
2015-11-29 19:04:10	duncaen	i guess you didn't use the -S flag to sync your repo?
2015-11-29 19:04:36	fanderal	first cmd was xbps-install -Su
2015-11-29 19:05:44	fanderal	for firefox: xbps-install -S firefox
2015-11-29 19:06:02	duncaen	ok

2015-11-29 19:06:19	duncaen	could you give the exact output
2015-11-29 19:06:51	fanderal	hafta do the cmd again, be back with it

2015-11-29 19:16:46	duncaen	how long is it ago that you did xbps-install -Su?
2015-11-29 19:17:13	fanderal	10 minutes before the install cmd
2015-11-29 19:17:27	fanderal	all done in the last couple of hours
2015-11-29 19:18:13	duncaen	thats strange, libharfbuzz us actually on version 1.1.2 and requestres linicudata.so.56 which is in the repository
2015-11-29 19:18:30	duncaen	are you using some other repository mirror or something?
2015-11-29 19:19:16	fanderal	give me a few minutes... wanna check which iso and repos

2015-11-29 19:26:41	fanderal	libharfbuzz was not among the libs to be updated

2015-11-30 22:43:45	whiteline	hi, i'm underway to set up voidlinux on an old hp pavilion. Now, among other, i encounter a problem with the wireless. So far, i configured all and i can connect to the SSID using wpa_supplicant. But then, i'm prompted with the question "he wireless network was encrypted. You must have the encryption key"
2015-11-30 22:44:08	duncaen	Gottox: is this schranz?
2015-11-30 22:44:23	Gottox	they call it "Angstpop"
2015-11-30 22:44:35	Gottox	but it's rather noise than schranz.
2015-11-30 22:44:38	whiteline	What does that mean? The wireless passwd obviously not, since it does not change anything ...?
2015-11-30 22:45:47	whiteline	Btw, i desire: would be nice if there were ceni in the repositories ... ;)
2015-11-30 22:46:08	duncaen	did you add your key to the config with wpa_passpharse?

2015-11-30 22:54:52	whiteline	my wpa_supplicant apparently looks good: there is SSID psk=<passwd> psk=<key>
2015-11-30 22:55:21	whiteline	Should i comment out passwd or key?
2015-11-30 22:56:18	whiteline	The connection is there but i've no access ...
2015-11-30 22:57:32	whiteline	OTOH, i tried with wicd which laments about missing dbus socket. And the same does connmanctl ?
2015-11-30 23:02:57	duncaen	because dbus is not running by default, you have to activate the service
2015-11-30 23:03:08	duncaen	but you should comment out password and only have the key
2015-11-30 23:03:24	duncaen	which is by default if its generated by wpa_passphrase right?
2015-11-30 23:04:33	whiteline	Do i understand right, that when i use "wpa_passphrase <my ssid> >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf" i'm prompted for the pswd to the router. And that pswd then gets encrypted?
2015-11-30 23:05:53	whiteline	As for dbus: I ran it but the lament rests. Is there to do some configuration. Sorry, i'm really unexperienced with that?

2015-11-30 23:25:21	whiteline	The router gives an ip etc. ...
2015-11-30 23:25:46	duncaen	we use the upstream wpa_supplicant without patches, should be the same if the version macthes
2015-11-30 23:26:12	duncaen	the router gives you an ip if you have a dhcp client running
2015-11-30 23:26:19	whiteline	May be i should steal the nice wifi.sh (of tinycore) ... ?
2015-11-30 23:26:23	duncaen	your system has to use the ip that the router assignes you
2015-11-30 23:27:15	duncaen	dont know how the wifi.sh from tinycore works, someone here also created a wifish that is in the repository

2015-12-02 21:53:17	psyq	thanks qball 
2015-12-02 21:54:11	Reala	I'm using musl right now.
2015-12-02 21:54:20	Reala	Probably never again on x86 or amd64, though.
2015-12-02 21:55:54	duncaen	because everything is so much smaller
2015-12-02 21:56:11	duncaen	somehow you have to fill your ram, right
2015-12-02 21:59:32	psyq	Reala: how is it working for you?
2015-12-02 22:00:32	Reala	psyq: Exactly the same as glibc, except that a few programs I rather would like to run don't work with musl.
2015-12-02 22:00:44	Reala	Also, no Wine.
2015-12-02 22:01:20	Reala	And I can't run any games I want to, since they were compiled with a glibc system.
2015-12-02 22:01:39	Reala	So like I said, I'll probably never do this again for an x86 or amd64 system.
2015-12-02 22:04:06	psyq	It sounds like I should stick with the nonmusl version then
2015-12-02 22:04:06	Reala	I've hit problems related to both desktop usage and using the machine for development, since one of my main languages needs the Boehm GC, which doesn't work on musl.
2015-12-02 22:04:32	Reala	That's my recommendation, yes :)
2015-12-02 22:05:15	psyq	okie thanks Reala

2015-12-07 20:28:59	mid-kid	If anybody's interested, I've found pdnsd.
2015-12-07 20:29:19	mid-kid	It's kind of what I was looking for.
2015-12-07 20:29:35	mid-kid	Only sad thing is that the cache is a binary file, so no easy editing of the cache.
2015-12-07 20:35:31	duncaen	doesnt cache djbdns to disk?
2015-12-07 20:35:40	mid-kid	I dunno.
2015-12-07 20:35:58	mid-kid	I never heard of that, even when searching.
2015-12-07 20:36:12	duncaen	http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html
2015-12-07 20:37:18	xcelq	do you guys believe terminal should be 80:24?
2015-12-07 20:38:00	mid-kid	It's the standard size set by the BIOS, so yes.
2015-12-07 20:38:13	mid-kid	Absolutely everyone has at least that size.
2015-12-07 20:39:46	mid-kid	djbdns looks even older than pdnsd, I'm not sure if it even caches to disk, and I've already set up pdnsd, and don't care enough to check it out.
2015-12-07 20:40:04	mid-kid	Both aren't in the repo.

2015-12-13 18:18:47	Spencer_H	I made a mess, and probably should have asked first, but I didn't know it would make so much of a mess. Is there a way to rebase without creating new commits?
2015-12-13 18:23:07	duncaen	this is what rebase does?
2015-12-13 18:23:27	duncaen	https://github.com/voidlinux/documentation/wiki/How-to-use-git,-by-@pullmoll
2015-12-13 18:24:23	Spencer_H	ah so I should have done it with squash. Also I don't know how I hadn't found this document before.
2015-12-13 18:25:26	duncaen	you use squash to git multiple commits into one
2015-12-13 18:25:43	duncaen	git pull --rebase upstream master is what i do in my pull requests
2015-12-13 18:26:50	Spencer_H	I just did git pull upstream master
2015-12-13 18:26:55	Spencer_H	which may be what caused me the problem.
2015-12-13 18:27:19	Spencer_H	Should I leave it as is or could someone walk me through reseting it to where it was before I screwed it up?
2015-12-13 18:29:40	duncaen	thats a merge and not a rebase if you just pull
2015-12-13 18:31:35	Spencer_H	So I have discovered
2015-12-13 18:31:53	Spencer_H	So is there no way to rebase to upstream without all of the commits between now and when I started showing up?
2015-12-13 18:32:43	duncaen	git pull --rebase upstream master
2015-12-13 18:33:33	Spencer_H	Ok. And that's it? It still says there are 54 commits different between local and origin now.
2015-12-13 18:33:48	Spencer_H	Do I just use git push --force
2015-12-13 18:33:54	duncaen	yes
2015-12-13 18:34:07	duncaen	origin is missing the 54 commits from master
2015-12-13 18:34:13	Spencer_H	alright
2015-12-13 18:34:25	duncaen	by rebasing you changed your commit history and have to force push it then
2015-12-13 18:35:20	Spencer_H	Ok perfect. Now there's only the one commit, thanks.
2015-12-13 18:36:17	Spencer_H	Why does git feel so hard to use >_<
2015-12-13 18:38:37	duncaen	because you didn't read the man pages :P
2015-12-13 18:59:30	Spencer_H	That's probably true.
2015-12-13 18:59:53	Spencer_H	The man pages are also massive. Maybe I'll dedicate a weekend to it some time.

2015-12-14 20:02:22	GangstaCat	I wanted to create a forum account but got a problem with my email so will answer here quickly about https://forum.voidlinux.eu/t/first-impressions-of-void/65 - the fact is I encountered the same problems as this guy 1- the TTY console on the first login, someone say that's by design but nowhere wrote in the wiki which I followed 2- yeah the tab thing under root, weird 3- the font was ugly in the console at first with some letters on others I installed
2015-12-14 20:02:22	GangstaCat	xorg-fonts, nice font in the console but in the browser the fonts where changed too and I don't like it so I uninstalled xorg-fonts but the font are still there so maybe something to check here for future releases 4- the brightness is way too much and I haven't any Graphics panel in the System configuration and didn't really managed to fix that 5- ufw don't start at boot and I don't know if this is a problem from the package installation or the program
2015-12-14 20:02:23	GangstaCat	which only auto-boot himself on certain distrib due to some design choices

2015-12-14 20:11:46	duncaen	yea you need to install nicer fonts

2015-12-15 22:15:28	well_laid_lawn	after not updating my arch install for two years to avoid systemd bloat, it's nice to have an up to date system again. browser bloat seems to have risen exponentially though... I've tried a few of the lighter browsers and netsurf seems to be what I'm after but I can't figure out how to configure it
2015-12-15 22:15:47	well_laid_lawn	it seems to need to be run on riscOS to be configured

2015-12-16 23:38:59	duncaen	which kernel can you boot?
2015-12-16 23:39:14	duncaen	*which version is the one panicing
2015-12-16 23:42:02	GangstaCat	4.2.8_1
2015-12-16 23:42:21	GangstaCat	and the last version was the previous one
2015-12-16 23:43:57	duncaen	so it didnt delete the wrong ones
2015-12-16 23:44:07	duncaen	was there to less space while updating?
2015-12-16 23:44:58	duncaen	i would boot a live cd and chroot into your void installation and run xbps-reconfigure -f linux4.2 to reinstall the kernel and regenerating the initramfs
2015-12-16 23:45:14	GangstaCat	no I gave 128MB to the /boot partition as said in installation guides and I installed the distrib like some days ago so the previous kernel was the only one installed
2015-12-16 23:45:38	GangstaCat	will try, thanks
2015-12-16 23:46:27	duncaen	maybe try to install linux4.1 or linux-lts too, if its really a problem with 4.2 then you can select the other kernels while booting and dont have to chroot again
2015-12-16 23:51:04	GangstaCat	I think the last version I had was 4.2.7_1
2015-12-16 23:51:14	GangstaCat	without any problem

2015-12-17 23:19:18	qball	unsure
2015-12-17 23:19:26	qball	had 101 gig free, now 96 left
2015-12-17 23:19:43	qball	need to split this hdd in twine and install linux on the other half
2015-12-17 23:19:52	qball	wonder if all surface issues are fixed under linux
2015-12-17 23:19:55	maldridge	s/twine/twane
2015-12-17 23:20:06	maldridge	oh, its an MS Surface?
2015-12-17 23:20:13	qball	yep
2015-12-17 23:20:19	qball	finally got it back again
2015-12-17 23:20:23	maldridge	I thought you couldn't unlock the secure boot keys on those
2015-12-17 23:20:25	qball	hopefully this one is actually working
2015-12-17 23:20:29	qball	you can trivial
2015-12-17 23:20:46	qball	just go into bios, -> disable secure boot
2015-12-17 23:21:08	qball	even with secure boot I did already manage to run it off usb stick fine
2015-12-17 23:21:38	qball	mostly worried about standby and battery life
2015-12-17 23:22:34	qball	because that has been frigging brilliant
2015-12-17 23:25:26	qball	less brilliant was it breaking after 14 months..  getting broken replacement spending 4 days on phone to get it fixed again
2015-12-17 23:26:51	maldridge	well, I can't say I'm surprised by the customer service issues
2015-12-17 23:26:56	maldridge	what broke?
2015-12-17 23:29:53	qball	the connector to the keyboard
2015-12-17 23:30:12	maldridge	wow, I thought that was a fairly indestructable magnetic coupler
2015-12-17 23:30:23	qball	then the next one did this: http://images.sarine.nl/tablet/
2015-12-17 23:30:33	qball	not sure what broke, but keyboard did not get power anymore
2015-12-17 23:30:36	qball	and did not work
2015-12-17 23:30:58	qball	got a new one now (refurbished) it has a tiny cosmetic ding
2015-12-17 23:31:02	qball	but so far worked fine
2015-12-17 23:31:22	qball	owh and microsoft breaks privacy laws, so I am going to file an official complaint
2015-12-17 23:31:45	qball	when I mentioned this on the phone to got angry at me and told me that if I did not agree I would not get service
2015-12-17 23:32:19	qball	never had helpdesk people get angry at me before
2015-12-17 23:32:27	qball	this time it happed twice
2015-12-17 23:32:48	duncaen	oh .nl nice
2015-12-17 23:33:20	maldridge	which specific case are you going to file the complaint on
2015-12-17 23:33:22	qball	duncaen: sorry should I have used an .org .eu or .com domain?
2015-12-17 23:33:28	maldridge	and who do you even file a complaint with for that
2015-12-17 23:33:40	duncaen	no represent your hood
2015-12-17 23:33:57	qball	maldridge: they record the conversation and share it with all there partners in every country they are active.
2015-12-17 23:34:03	qball	then force you to give private information on phone
2015-12-17 23:34:07	qball	this is against the law
2015-12-17 23:34:13	qball	as it is not needed to provide service
2015-12-17 23:34:32	maldridge	what is your locale? pretty sure that's fair game or a US company
2015-12-17 23:34:37	maldridge	if a little dodgy
2015-12-17 23:34:41	qball	it aint here
2015-12-17 23:34:56	qball	and get them up to 830.000 euro fine (well next year)
2015-12-17 23:35:21	duncaen	or eu just votes against all this and we are fucked too
2015-12-17 23:35:28	qball	true
2015-12-17 23:36:07	duncaen	but at the moment it seems fine but our politicans are pushing against it .,
2015-12-17 23:36:09	qball	but microsoft also first gave me 1 year warrenty.
2015-12-17 23:36:12	maldridge	ah, y'all are eu
2015-12-17 23:36:28	qball	but they did fix that in the end, so it says two years now
2015-12-17 23:36:47	qball	they don't have to give me warenty at all, the store should
2015-12-17 23:37:00	qball	but the stores claims that microsoft only accepts claims from the owner directly
2015-12-17 23:37:24	qball	and they kind of confirmed this on the ms side
2015-12-17 23:39:26	qball	owh fuck this os.. microsoft is pushing adds 'try office 356 for one month for free` to my notification center
2015-12-17 23:40:15	qball	lets blame mike!
2015-12-17 23:40:34	qball	so enough about me
2015-12-17 23:40:39	qball	how is everybody
2015-12-17 23:40:46	maldridge	I spent quite some time getting windows off of a tablet
2015-12-17 23:40:55	maldridge	still doesn't work very well, but that isn't my primary machine
2015-12-17 23:42:03	qball	I normally used a virtual machine with linux in it

2015-12-20 20:36:59	Jolt2bolt	lol
2015-12-20 20:37:12	Jolt2bolt	I have a question
2015-12-20 20:37:49	duncaen	ok
2015-12-20 20:37:49	Jolt2bolt	what is the diference between glibc and musl. I saw differents iso. what are the pro and cons?
2015-12-20 20:37:52	duncaen	Hi
2015-12-20 20:38:38	duncaen	depends on what you prefer but if you dont know, the glibc version is a better pick atm
2015-12-20 20:38:39	anth_	I'm just in the process of installing void and I am using LUKS (no boot partition) and btrfs subvolumes in the crypt container. Is there any way I can direct the void-installer to the mount point I made for the subvolumes? (I did /mnt/root)
2015-12-20 20:38:40	Jolt2bolt	I want to give it a try a void linux. but i saw void use two diferent c libraries for that, so i got curious about that...
2015-12-20 20:39:32	duncaen	anth_: you could do a chroot installation, the installer has only very basic features
2015-12-20 20:40:00	duncaen	http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html
2015-12-20 20:40:24	duncaen	if you have to use precompiled binaries, steam etc you should pick glibc
2015-12-20 20:40:56	anth_	ah, how would one go about that? I know that I can chroot to /mnt/root and then set up grub/fstab myself no problem -- and an initramfs? (should be able to do all three) but where do I grab the files from
2015-12-20 20:40:58	anth_	?*
2015-12-20 20:41:32	Jolt2bolt	duncaen, binaries is skype on that group?
2015-12-20 20:41:37	duncaen	yes
2015-12-20 20:42:37	Jolt2bolt	but if i want to use musl, what change i must do?

2015-12-20 20:45:48	duncaen	Jolt2bolt: reinstallation or reinstalling all packages with a script from a different repository, probably a bit risky and i dont know if anyone ever tried it
2015-12-20 20:46:12	anth_	perfect, thanks duncaen! :)
2015-12-20 20:46:19	anth_	should be really easy now ;)
2015-12-20 20:46:52	Jolt2bolt	so i rather bet for glibc... i would like to speak with someone that got experiences with musl. so i must knoe what i can expect...
2015-12-20 20:48:09	Jolt2bolt	well downloading glibc version
2015-12-20 20:48:35	Jolt2bolt	i will try musl version in a virtual machine
2015-12-20 20:49:34	Jolt2bolt	by the way, the net install version is the one without DE names, right?

2015-12-21 00:15:24	robotanarchy	hi there. I'm trying to write a template for xbps, but somehow xbps-src does not even download the distfiles :-\
2015-12-21 00:15:35	robotanarchy	https://paste.geekify.de/plwhdxmzw
2015-12-21 00:15:42	robotanarchy	what am I doing wrong?
2015-12-21 00:16:36	robotanarchy	I'm using the arch linux AUR PKGBUILD for reference: https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=wlc-git
2015-12-21 00:17:34	robotanarchy	oh and is there a way to let xbps generate the checksum?
2015-12-21 00:18:52	lemmi	robotanarchy: in the xtools package xgensum
2015-12-21 00:19:46	robotanarchy	lemmi: thanks
2015-12-21 00:25:53	robotanarchy	lemmi: ok, I guess that was the problem? now I've got other errors which I probably can figure out by myself

2015-12-21 00:32:26	robotanarchy	I've generated the checksum with xgensum (which also downloaded the source package) and now xbps-src continues
2015-12-21 00:33:30	robotanarchy	another question: in the 'Manual.md' it says: xbps-src will skip the steps, that have completed successfully. but it is *always* preparing the build environment etc, which takes pretty long
2015-12-21 00:34:37	robotanarchy	eg. I run fetch and extract, and in both steps it does 'removing autodeps, please wait...' and 'building...' and installing all dependencies. From the Manual.md I thought it would skip these steps then
2015-12-21 00:37:48	Gottox	you can manually skip autoremoval and reinstall with the -I flag

2015-12-22 21:55:17	robotanarchy	actually it needs to be agetty-autologin-tty1 instead of agetty-tty1-autologin, because the run script thinks that 'autologin' is the port otherwise. but it works now :) I'll add this to the wiki soon

2015-12-23 23:51:18	mushroomblue	hi guys. thinking of switching from gentoo.
2015-12-23 23:52:03	mushroomblue	any part of this project located within the jurisdiction of UK/USA/Canada/NZ/AU ?
2015-12-23 23:52:13	mushroomblue	(individual contributors notwithstanding)
2015-12-23 23:52:42	mushroomblue	I'm trying to avoid the stuff that the cryptostorm guys are talking about.
2015-12-24 00:00:56	duncaen	mushroomblue: repositories, server or what?
2015-12-24 00:02:03	mushroomblue	repositories can probably be dealt with due to just using mirrors, but governance of the project is more what I'm concerned about.
2015-12-24 00:02:21	duncaen	there is no governance
2015-12-24 00:02:23	mushroomblue	i.e. Red Hat is in the US, Canonical is in City of London, etc.
2015-12-24 00:02:32	duncaen	we are not a foundation or anything
2015-12-24 00:02:35	mushroomblue	that's comforting.
2015-12-24 00:04:19	duncaen	buildservers are located in germany and the one for musl in france
2015-12-24 00:05:33	mushroomblue	The EU has (so far) been a decent steward of internet rights, outside of BREIN and company.
2015-12-24 00:06:04	mushroomblue	and seeing as IP isn't an issue for free software, it's not a disqualifier imo.
2015-12-24 00:07:03	mushroomblue	I got massive pushback in #gentoo for even wanting to build LibreSSL, so I'm running away screaming, and Void will probably be my solution. thank you for the info.

2015-12-28 21:29:50	chessandgo	hello, this is the offical voidlinux.eu irc, correct?
2015-12-28 21:30:16	koomi	yes
2015-12-28 21:30:56	chessandgo	ah, thats good, I just had some questions.
2015-12-28 21:31:57	chessandgo	I was look at the wiki, the begginers guide seems to be empty. Is it that much different than the arch begginers guide
2015-12-28 21:33:39	duncaen	not really
2015-12-28 21:34:02	duncaen	the configuration of $pkgname is basically the same
2015-12-28 21:34:23	chessandgo	ah, good. And I was wondering about packaging
2015-12-28 21:34:44	duncaen	https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
2015-12-28 21:34:54	duncaen	and the README.md for basic setup
2015-12-28 21:35:21	duncaen	and MANUAL.md is a extended documentation about template files
2015-12-28 21:35:26	duncaen	*MANUALS.md
2015-12-28 21:35:37	duncaen	*Manual.md :D
2015-12-28 21:35:55	chessandgo	less about compiling, as the package is often fetched from jenkins or a similar build server (its a .jar)
2015-12-28 21:36:38	duncaen	do you want it in the main repository or just locally in an package to keep track of it with xbps?
2015-12-28 21:37:11	chessandgo	either or, but offical would be nice
2015-12-28 21:37:39	chessandgo	the dev build of it is more or less just fetched from http://jenkins.movingblocks.net/job/DistroOmega/343/artifact/distros/omega/build/distributions/TerasologyOmega.zip , for the AUR
2015-12-28 21:37:47	chessandgo	but a gitpage does exist
2015-12-28 21:37:53	chessandgo	is one prefered over the other
2015-12-28 21:39:05	duncaen	depends on the software in general we prefer fixed releases compiled from source but for java stuff most some packages just use the provided jars
2015-12-28 21:40:18	chessandgo	yea, as I noticed minecraft was in repos. we have a stable, a dev build, and a launcher that can download either. Does the release cycle matter much as its a self contained jar
2015-12-28 21:42:07	duncaen	i think the stable would be preffered for the repository, a template points to a specific version and you would have to update it for each dev build
2015-12-28 21:43:36	chessandgo	hm, so dev build would for source
2015-12-28 21:47:27	chessandgo	on last things, void-live-x86_64-20151110.iso is the minimal correct? (no DE).
2015-12-28 22:02:44	duncaen	yes
2015-12-28 22:03:58	duncaen	if you choose to install form network with a desktop flavour image, it would just install the minimal base, desktop is only installed if you use local as package source
2015-12-28 22:04:25	chessandgo	hm, does the DE versions offer anything useful
2015-12-28 22:04:39	chessandgo	I have a network connection at hand, and I'm planning on just using i3wm
2015-12-28 22:06:48	duncaen	doesnt make a big difference, the desktop images just have some packages installed by default no extra configs etc
2015-12-28 22:07:17	duncaen	just use the minimal one, or the desktop one if you already have it
2015-12-28 22:07:57	chessandgo	lastly, is there anything I should be forewards about for drivers.
2015-12-28 22:08:18	chessandgo	All I use is a broadcom and a fan one from the AUR
2015-12-28 22:09:35	duncaen	if you need broadcom-wl-dkms you have to activate the nonfree repo (xbps-install -S void-repo-nonfree)
2015-12-28 22:09:56	duncaen	you probably need linux-firmware-network too
2015-12-28 22:10:19	duncaen	b43-fwcutter is in the main repo if you need this
2015-12-28 22:10:43	duncaen	not sure which fan driver/tool you need
2015-12-28 22:11:07	chessandgo	macfan-id
2015-12-28 22:11:43	duncaen	hm i dont think its packaged
2015-12-28 22:11:53	chessandgo	broadcom-wl 6.30.223.271-1 is the specific driver for wireless
2015-12-28 22:12:52	chessandgo	is there a place I can browse the nonfree repo like I can the main repo on the site
2015-12-28 22:12:58	duncaen	then broadcom-wl-dkms from the nonfree repo should be correct broadcom-wl-dkms-6.30.223.271_1
2015-12-28 22:13:18	chessandgo	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/macfanctld/ fan driver is simple enough
2015-12-28 22:13:21	duncaen	on the site all packages are included
2015-12-28 22:13:43	chessandgo	ah
2015-12-28 22:14:34	chessandgo	given the wireless and it being rolling release, anything I should know about how often kernel updates happen
2015-12-28 22:14:50	chessandgo	sooner than Arch?
2015-12-28 22:16:47	duncaen	hm depends on the release cycle of the kernel normally we wait for *.1 and first provide it as package like linux4.3 that you can install but its not a requierement until we decide its stable and then the base switched to this kernel
2015-12-28 22:17:30	duncaen	and there is linux-lts if you dont want to updated that often
2015-12-28 22:17:46	chessandgo	you got a void desktop? whats the current release. uname -r for me is saying 4.2.5-1
2015-12-28 22:18:51	duncaen	4.3.3 is the default at the moment
2015-12-28 22:19:18	duncaen	4.2 is still available as linux4.2
2015-12-28 22:19:24	duncaen	you can install them all parallel
2015-12-28 22:19:35	chessandgo	hm, thanks
2015-12-28 22:19:57	chessandgo	welp, hopefully next time i'm in here its because of a successful install
2015-12-28 22:20:11	chessandgo	ext4 prefered?
2015-12-28 22:20:54	duncaen	if you prefer it :)
2015-12-28 22:21:33	chessandgo	whats everyone else use these days, brtfs
2015-12-28 22:22:37	duncaen	i think most use ext4, btrfs is considered stable but i read about problems and choose against it
2015-12-28 22:22:48	duncaen	i think a few here use btrfs without problems
2015-12-28 22:23:54	chessandgo	heh, server uses btrfs just for laughts
2015-12-28 22:24:01	chessandgo	nothings gone wrong with it
2015-12-28 22:24:09	chessandgo	but perhaps thats a testimate to debian not brtfs
2015-12-28 22:30:28	chessandgo	duncaen: I've got an EFI system, anything special need to be down, since i'll be moving away from systemd
2015-12-28 22:32:51	duncaen	no i dont think so, gpt parition tables and https://wiki.voidlinux.eu/A_Note_About_GRUB_And_UEFI and maybe https://wiki.voidlinux.eu/Installation_on_UEFI,_via_chroot as reference to confirm
2015-12-28 22:35:28	chessandgo	thanks, welp, i'll be collecting mystuff. Hopefully it'll have an install soon.
2015-12-28 22:35:37	chessandgo	duncaen: thanks for everything

2015-12-28 22:58:54	duncaen	traeak: are you sure dbus runs correctly
2015-12-28 22:59:14	traeak	not sure what "runs correctly" means
2015-12-28 22:59:35	traeak	when i query dbus for ListNames of all system services the list is comparable
2015-12-28 22:59:57	traeak	just be nice to know what rule is causing access denied
2015-12-28 23:00:01	duncaen	and the connmand service is enabled too?
2015-12-28 23:00:03	traeak	or on the other hand causing access granded
2015-12-28 23:00:15	traeak	if i run sudo the stuff works
2015-12-28 23:00:18	traeak	not interested in that :-p
2015-12-28 23:00:42	traeak	groups are identical on machines
2015-12-28 23:00:43	traeak	hmm
2015-12-28 23:01:04	duncaen	does it need consolekit?
2015-12-28 23:01:06	traeak	i wish i could figure out how to make dbus-send give me more info on the failed on
2015-12-28 23:01:33	traeak	and less infoboth machines are running consolekit although not sure
2015-12-28 23:02:09	duncaen	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/voidlinux/Oqb5Fcg4kTA looks like your problem, but no answer
2015-12-28 23:02:28	traeak	yeah...that's the first link that comes up :-p

2015-12-28 23:03:41	Guest96095	koomi, I don't know what you're talking about it's just great
2015-12-28 23:04:20	Guest96095	anyone knows what would make "Bootable" option appear in partitioning?
2015-12-28 23:05:26	Guest96095	like this guy at 1:09 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXfj5QCR8N0
2015-12-28 23:06:07	eater	Guest96095: it only appears in mbr partition tables for some reason
2015-12-28 23:06:30	traeak	yeah
2015-12-28 23:06:53	traeak	i hvae a buggy board here which needs to have the boot byte set on a GPT system
2015-12-28 23:07:04	traeak	have to go in manually and flip that byte
2015-12-28 23:07:14	traeak	busted assed bios
2015-12-28 23:07:22	eater	damn
2015-12-28 23:07:38	eater	Guest96095: you maybe can use cgdisk or fdisk to set it to bootable
2015-12-28 23:07:38	traeak	doubtful you need it for gpt though
2015-12-28 23:07:44	traeak	is what i'm assuming you are asking about ?
2015-12-28 23:08:03	Guest96095	i'll try that
2015-12-28 23:08:20	traeak	fdisk you can switch bootable with the 'a' option, for mbr stuffz
2015-12-28 23:17:16	Guest96095	I tried to set it to dos instead of gpt this time, now it allows for "bootable"
2015-12-28 23:17:46	eater	yep
2015-12-28 23:17:53	eater	dos == mdr btw
2015-12-28 23:17:56	eater	*mbr
2015-12-28 23:18:28	duncaen	but efi want gpt right?
2015-12-28 23:19:10	eater	mbr only does bios yes
2015-12-28 23:20:42	well_laid_lawn	sounds like a vbox setting for the boot needs changing
2015-12-28 23:31:18	Guest96095	it werks now guys

2015-12-29 22:09:02	berndstein	hm, any ideas why i3 "font pango:…" lines would not work? (i3 always using some kind of small serif font)
2015-12-29 22:09:11	berndstein	missing some package maybe?
2015-12-29 22:10:12	qball	works for me.  wrong font?
2015-12-29 22:11:18	berndstein	even the default "font pango:monospace 8", tweaking the 8 to other sizes has no effect. weird
2015-12-29 22:12:54	berndstein	i guess the config is completely borked
2015-12-29 22:13:07	duncaen	did you install any font?
2015-12-29 22:13:11	berndstein	yes duncaen
2015-12-29 22:13:33	berndstein	and used fc-cache -fv
2015-12-29 22:14:38	berndstein	sorry, i'm just a super idiot i think, edited /etc/i3/config instead of my local .config/i3… stuff.
2015-12-29 22:14:43	duncaen	and what does fc-match monospace say?
2015-12-29 22:15:11	berndstein	yeah, that was it. how embarassing :3
2015-12-29 22:15:18	duncaen	:P
2015-12-29 22:16:34	berndstein	one more noob question: i did xbps-install -Suv for the first time after installing from the release iso, and after restarting i think the font rendering changed in general. is that possible or hallucinations?
2015-12-29 22:18:36	well_laid_lawn	have you taken any hallucinogens?
2015-12-29 22:19:00	berndstein	well_laid_lawn: not knowingly :D
2015-12-29 22:33:58	qball	yet you installed void
2015-12-29 22:34:14	berndstein	indeed
2015-12-29 22:34:54	berndstein	do i have to install any locale packages or sth to be able to put de_DE.UTF-8 in /etc/locale.conf? or does it work differently?
2015-12-29 22:35:34	berndstein	whatever, it's not so important. i guess en_US.UTF-8 is fine
2015-12-29 22:36:16	berndstein	just to be able to type äöü would be nice, so need to find out how to change to the correct keymap
2015-12-29 22:37:01	qball	setxkmap de_
2015-12-29 22:39:32	berndstein	qball: ah. i tried that first, but then wasnt able to type äöü in roxterm. now tested in parallel in emacs and there it works. so it's roxterms fault, maybe it's not set to use utf8
2015-12-29 22:40:35	berndstein	(gtk emacs)
2015-12-29 23:00:58	berndstein	ah weird. locale charmap gives ANSI_X3.4-1968 :D

2016-01-02 19:12:05	K`	Hi. I am having problems installing Void.
2016-01-02 19:12:41	K`	First. It does not connect to my wireless in the installer. I am manually connecting using wpa_cli
2016-01-02 19:13:36	K`	Secondly, the installer gets stuck downloading x86-64_repodata file at around 72%.
2016-01-02 19:13:56	K`	Also, the internet seems to work very slow.

2016-01-02 19:22:19	Gottox	try an alternative mirror: http://www.voidlinux.eu/usage/xbps/

2016-01-04 02:15:28	maldridge	it looks like the perl support is factored out to another package
2016-01-04 02:15:57	mvaenskae	no, hasn't been installed and there is no prebuilt package avaiable except x86
2016-01-04 02:16:21	maldridge	ah, you are trying to do all this on a pi if I had to guess
2016-01-04 02:17:02	mvaenskae	yup
2016-01-04 02:17:37	mvaenskae	original pi b to be precise
2016-01-04 02:17:38	maldridge	I don't see any reason that package wouldn't be built for arm, lemme go check the build box log to see if there was an error
2016-01-04 02:17:49	mvaenskae	thanks :)
2016-01-04 02:18:13	mvaenskae	i cannot anything except irssi and irssi-devel with xbps-query
2016-01-04 02:18:35	maldridge	that's what I see as well
2016-01-04 02:20:55	maldridge	I don't see why that wouldn't be built, xtraeme uses irssi though so I would ask him
2016-01-04 02:21:41	maldridge	(coincidentally, he's also the package maintainer)
2016-01-04 02:24:30	mvaenskae	you know how i realised something was missing?
2016-01-04 02:25:27	maldridge	none of your config worked?
2016-01-04 02:25:40	mvaenskae	because of a channel i can usually post in requesting me to login where i was asking for help on udev due to my yubikey still not working... that's a very long path to take from yubikey to irssi
2016-01-04 02:26:23	mvaenskae	i usually use sasl to login in freenode but it never authenticated... interesting that it didn't make me change my username forcefully

2016-01-04 20:25:03	psyq	I am having a problem with me trying to get the dejavu for powerline to work in my terminal and vim and I can't seem to get it working anyone have any idea what I might be doing wrong?
2016-01-04 20:27:35	duncaen	creating the fontdir updating the font cache?
2016-01-04 20:28:05	psyq	I have done that

2016-01-04 20:28:46	duncaen	and you use the modified name?
2016-01-04 20:28:54	psyq	it is like it loads the dejavu font but not the one for powerline

2016-01-05 22:52:40	eater	this laptop doesn't have a ethernet connection
2016-01-05 22:52:44	eater	it only has wifi
2016-01-05 22:52:54	eater	I could make an install cd with that package tho
2016-01-05 22:55:05	duncaen	or download the package from repo.voidlinux.eu/current and install it manually
2016-01-05 22:56:37	eater	ehhh, Im going to create my own cd, looks easier
2016-01-05 22:58:04	duncaen	editing one file + creating the new iso vs downloading one file + creating a local repository + installing from local repository
2016-01-05 22:58:11	duncaen	2 vs 3 your right
2016-01-05 22:58:51	eater	not really editing one file tho, just running a command :p ./mklive.sh -p 'wifi-firmware'
2016-01-05 22:59:39	duncaen	ok that works too, thought about editing build-x87...sh
2016-01-05 22:59:48	duncaen	*86
2016-01-05 23:00:26	duncaen	without the packages from the script your missing dependencies for the installer

2016-01-05 23:01:29	duncaen	what is elementary acutally, thought its only some polished but bad gui, do they have their own base system?
2016-01-05 23:01:44	eater	duncaen: true, but I've done it before so not a big deal /for me/

2016-01-05 23:02:16	eater	yeah ubuntu because this is version 15.10 iirc
2016-01-05 23:02:25	duncaen	hm ok

2016-01-05 23:07:55	qball	vala :D
2016-01-05 23:07:58	duncaen	all their apps are programmed in vala which is some sort of c# i guess
2016-01-05 23:08:13	qball	vala is object something that compiles into C + gobjectś
2016-01-05 23:08:22	qball	it is nice to write in if you write gtk apps
2016-01-05 23:08:50	duncaen	its really compiled?
2016-01-05 23:09:05	eater	hng since Im in linux I've kept away from writing GUI things except HTML
2016-01-05 23:09:08	duncaen	into c you mean translated to c and then compiled?
2016-01-05 23:09:20	qball	yes translated to c and then compiled
2016-01-05 23:09:26	qball	but it does a bit mroe then just translating
2016-01-05 23:09:35	qball	as it does memory management (sort of) and more
2016-01-05 23:09:49	qball	packing, ref counting (if needed) etc
2016-01-05 23:10:19	duncaen	hm probably have to work with it to say something valid about it from my point of view it just looks awful xD
2016-01-05 23:10:35	qball	I used it in a couple of apps
2016-01-05 23:10:42	qball	better then writing gobject code by hand :D
2016-01-05 23:10:49	qball	gpx-viewer,gmpc, stuffkeeper
2016-01-05 23:11:39	duncaen	what makes it better, that you dont have to care about memory or that you have to write boilerplate object code xD?
2016-01-05 23:11:50	qball	would not use again.
2016-01-05 23:12:08	duncaen	ok, its probably hell to debug right?
2016-01-05 23:12:13	qball	well the boilerplate stuff mostly, you can write very compactly your code.
2016-01-05 23:12:39	qball	I never found it, because you can just look into the C code too.
2016-01-05 23:12:45	qball	a well, many years since I used it
2016-01-05 23:13:59	duncaen	ah ok you can see the c code, and as long as you can comprehend vala to c and know about c your good to go

2016-01-05 23:52:53	gregf	duncaen: thats it, i always think its build something
2016-01-05 23:52:58	eater	how do I create an live iso with a non-free package?
2016-01-05 23:53:06	gregf	duncaen: ty
2016-01-05 23:53:22	duncaen	eater: you have to add http://repo.voidlinux.eu/current/nonfree to the repositories
2016-01-05 23:53:47	eater	ah!
2016-01-05 23:53:50	eater	thanks duncaen
2016-01-05 23:54:07	eater	need to install the broadcom-wl-dkms package maybe then I will have wifi
2016-01-05 23:54:54	duncaen	hm probably, you have to compile the module on the running system then
2016-01-05 23:55:16	duncaen	xbps-reconfigure -f broadcom-wl-dkms to trigger the dkms build
2016-01-05 23:55:40	eater	and then rmmod && insmod?
2016-01-05 23:56:04	duncaen	yop, except you make a persistent live system
2016-01-05 23:56:40	duncaen	then you could reboot, but never tried it with a void live system
2016-01-05 23:57:11	eater	I wanted to make an EUFI LUKS LVM setup, but it seems I better first get these details working before I throw myself over that
2016-01-05 23:58:01	duncaen	that will probably suck, last time i got the efi luks lvm correctly i had to reboot multiple times until i had everything setup right
2016-01-05 23:58:53	duncaen	but if you have everything in your system and dont have to compile and insert the module everytime or you get it correct on your first or second try thats no problem
2016-01-05 23:59:05	eater	Im following a mix of these 2 "guides": https://wiki.voidlinux.eu/Install_LVM_LUKS & https://wiki.voidlinux.eu/Installation_on_UEFI,_via_chroot
2016-01-05 23:59:36	eater	I'll probably make a guide myself when I got it up and running
2016-01-05 23:59:39	duncaen	my efi system didn't detected grub right on my first tries
2016-01-05 23:59:59	duncaen	i also tried to have an encrypted boot partition but gave up on it later
2016-01-06 00:01:31	eater	I was really far but then I did grub-install
2016-01-06 00:01:41	eater	and it was like "yeah man thats encrypted, not gonna touch that"
2016-01-06 00:01:43	duncaen	i want to extend the wiki every time but then the wiki markup sucks and i would create hundrets of pages with just two or three sentences xD
2016-01-06 00:01:55	eater	dont we have markdown?
2016-01-06 00:02:28	eater	wireless works!!!!

2016-01-06 00:12:57	eater	tomorrow is a new day
2016-01-06 00:16:51	duncaen	:D
2016-01-06 00:17:06	duncaen	you have wifi now, can't you install it?
2016-01-06 00:17:58	eater	I could, yeah
2016-01-06 00:18:15	eater	but it's 0am and then I had to go through wpa_cli and figure things out again
2016-01-06 00:18:21	duncaen	:s
2016-01-06 00:18:40	eater	so just build a new iso again gonna write it to the stick and play with it tomorrow
2016-01-06 00:18:42	duncaen	actually using https://github.com/chneukirchen/hrmpf/ as installation system is not a bad idea too
2016-01-06 00:18:52	eater	thanks for the help tho

2016-01-12 21:17:05	SovereignBleak	I'm not feeling the KDE love from Void. All of the live images have GTK+ friendly environments except for LXQt which hardly rates.
2016-01-12 21:17:31	SovereignBleak	Show me the love, Void. It's the only thing keeping me on Arch.
2016-01-12 21:17:38	duncaen	then package kde5
2016-01-12 21:18:35	SovereignBleak	duncaen: I've heard it took 14 tries for one newbie to get their relatively simple package into your repo's. And I'm relatively fresh to a CLI. Though I can git clone and build packages from a PKGBUILD.
2016-01-12 21:19:13	SovereignBleak	duncaen: Packaging all of KDE5 seems mildly difficult to impossible for someone with my level of Linux aptitude.
2016-01-12 21:19:38	duncaen	yea its a lot and probably patching out systemd too
2016-01-12 21:19:58	Vaelatern	I'm amazed we have gnome 3

2016-01-12 21:22:47	SovereignBleak	See, I love the guys who love their terminals and tiling environments but for someone who wants to video edit with Kdenlive (which also isn't packaged on Void) it's not really congruent with our workflows.
2016-01-12 21:23:04	Vaelatern	This is a fair point
2016-01-12 21:23:33	Vaelatern	Other graphical environments are packaged
2016-01-12 21:24:36	SovereignBleak	Vaelatern: That is true and it's probably just my mildly irrational preference for pure KDE and Qt that keeps me from just using another environment. Well that and Kdenlive is considered a cut above the other video editors.
2016-01-12 21:25:37	Vaelatern	If you open an issue someone can have a look and try to package your video editor, and at least the request would be official.

2016-01-12 21:55:30	SovereignBleak	maldridge: But if you guys package a lot of your own stuff how do you keep it updated? This is the same issue I'm having with out-of-AUR and repo packages I've built myself.
2016-01-12 21:56:05	maldridge	SovereignBleak: I check upstream to see if it gets updated?  I don't see how that could be different on void from anywhere else
2016-01-12 21:57:23	SovereignBleak	maldridge: Well yeah but it's just annoyingly time-consuming. I love the Hell out of Linux but I also want to get some work done and not have to git sync and rebuild all of my sourced packages by hand.
2016-01-12 21:57:28	maldridge	at the end of the day, on every distro someone is checking every package to update it and apply any necessary changes or patches
2016-01-12 21:58:21	maldridge	SovereignBleak: I find it very hard to believe that you could be using any program that updates more than once a month, if that
2016-01-12 21:59:07	SovereignBleak	maldridge: Well how do you keep tabs on when those sourced packages are updated without checking the website everyday? I'm genuinely curious actually. Is there an RSS feed for that sort of thing?
2016-01-12 22:01:00	maldridge	there's really nothing that fancy, I'm subscribed to a few mailing lists, and I check a lot of websites
2016-01-12 22:01:25	maldridge	void has a system that compiles lists of outdated packages for packages that are configured to use it, but that depends on the upstream project not doing something stupid
2016-01-12 22:02:07	SovereignBleak	maldridge: Bam, timesink. But you probably love to do those things as do I.

2016-01-12 23:28:12	mender27	Hello!
2016-01-12 23:28:24	mender27	I have a major problem with booting after install now.
2016-01-12 23:28:44	mender27	Grub2 is somehow broken and doesn't find my xfs root partition.
2016-01-12 23:28:59	duncaen	grub?
2016-01-12 23:29:10	duncaen	do you have /boot on xfs?
2016-01-12 23:29:17	mender27	I tried installing LILO and it runs properly in a chroot, but then fails on boot.
2016-01-12 23:29:32	mender27	Nope, should I? I have an msdos table on that drive.
2016-01-12 23:29:47	duncaen	no i just aked whats you setup
2016-01-12 23:30:04	duncaen	the root partition is mounted in the initram thats after grub/bootloader
2016-01-12 23:30:15	mender27	Oh, sorry, should've started with that. I have / on /dev/sdb1, swap on /dev/sdb2 and /home on /dev/sdb3
2016-01-12 23:30:37	duncaen	and the filesystem of / is xfs?
2016-01-12 23:30:41	mender27	Yes
2016-01-12 23:30:48	mender27	Actually, home is also on xfs
2016-01-12 23:30:51	duncaen	and /boot is on /
2016-01-12 23:30:54	duncaen	?
2016-01-12 23:30:58	mender27	Exactly.
2016-01-12 23:31:07	mender27	I don't have /boot as a separate partition :)
2016-01-12 23:31:17	duncaen	i think that doesn't work with grub and it should be ext2/3
2016-01-12 23:32:55	mender27	Worked on all the other Linux distributions thus far :P.

2016-01-12 23:33:17	mender27	Unless Void does things differently :).
2016-01-12 23:33:36	duncaen	hm yea this version should support xfs
2016-01-12 23:33:40	mender27	I can have a separate /boot and run all the other partitions in ext4.
2016-01-12 23:34:00	duncaen	whats the actual problem/error?
2016-01-12 23:34:23	mender27	Grub doesn't find its boot partition I think. The main Grub screen doesn't even load.
2016-01-12 23:34:39	mender27	Same problem with LILO, actually.
2016-01-12 23:35:01	duncaen	did you toggle the bootflag?
2016-01-12 23:35:08	mender27	I sure did, yes.
2016-01-12 23:35:22	duncaen	hm
2016-01-12 23:35:32	mender27	I know, it's a weird issue
2016-01-12 23:35:44	duncaen	and /boot/grub exists?
2016-01-12 23:35:44	mender27	I thought I've seen most of them, but this one's new.
2016-01-12 23:36:10	mender27	Yes, though I uninstalled grub in favor of LILO, which is simpler to configure by hand
2016-01-12 23:36:20	duncaen	hm
2016-01-12 23:36:41	mender27	And a similar lilo.conf worked on Gentoo before.
2016-01-12 23:37:08	mender27	I think it's a matter of the bootloader not finding it's /boot for some reason.
2016-01-12 23:37:09	duncaen	yea if it doesn't show up it seems like something earlier
2016-01-12 23:37:32	mender27	I'll check the bootflag again, maybe that's the problem after all.
2016-01-12 23:37:48	mender27	Though it's weird, if any bootloader goes into the MBR, right?
2016-01-12 23:38:45	mender27	Maybe the Gentoo folks will know something.

2016-01-13 21:15:46	duncaen	yea should work fine
2016-01-13 21:16:24	devster31	the default is actually permitrootlogin prohibit-password
2016-01-13 21:16:25	devster31	lol
2016-01-13 21:16:45	duncaen	oh that new i think
2016-01-13 21:17:17	duncaen	yea changed in 7.0 http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.0
2016-01-13 21:17:32	duncaen	*6.9
2016-01-13 21:19:59	devster31	wasn't there a native windows implementation in the making for ssh?

2016-01-13 21:23:56	maldridge	yeah, its basically just the protocol I heard, they're writing all thier own crypto and such
2016-01-13 21:23:56	devster31	nice
2016-01-13 21:24:15	devster31	apparently muslc wasn't a good choice, can't even install xtools
2016-01-13 21:24:54	maldridge	muslc is meant for making small lean systems.  Its not necessarily the best option for a daily use system
2016-01-13 21:25:05	devster31	not a daily driver, it's a rpi
2016-01-13 21:25:23	duncaen	on a rpi its fine im using it
2016-01-13 21:25:28	devster31	so I figured it would be a good choice, but I can't install vim, which is kind of a dealbreaker
2016-01-13 21:25:30	duncaen	xtools should be no problem
2016-01-13 21:25:40	duncaen	i have vim oO
2016-01-13 21:25:49	devster31	I get error trans failed to download package from muslrepo.voidlinux.eu

2016-01-13 21:27:31	devster31	I already did it, I'll try again
2016-01-13 21:28:04	duncaen	there is definitively vim and xtools for musl in http://muslrepo.voidlinux.eu/current/

2016-01-13 21:37:39	devster31	how do I make it work? it tells me it doesn't recognize the device
2016-01-13 21:37:55	traeak	rpi or rpi2? not sure that matters though
2016-01-13 21:38:06	traeak	is it in your modules?

2016-01-13 21:39:02	traeak	firmware maybe?

2016-01-13 23:00:51	duncaen	depending on how you want your wifi managed
2016-01-13 23:01:01	duncaen	dhcpcd can handle wpa_supplicant, thats what i usually use
2016-01-13 23:01:12	duncaen	but there is also a runit service for wpa_supplicant alone
2016-01-13 23:02:23	devster31	I symlinked wpa_supplicant in the services but does the wlan0 interface go up automatically?
2016-01-13 23:04:02	duncaen	normally yes
2016-01-13 23:04:12	duncaen	is it really wlan0 and not wps2s0 or something?
2016-01-13 23:04:38	devster31	ip link shows wlan0
2016-01-13 23:04:46	devster31	lo eth0 and wlan0
2016-01-13 23:05:42	duncaen	then it should just work, wlan0 is the default in /etc/sv/wpa_supplicant/run
2016-01-13 23:06:57	devster31	ye, and do I need to keep the wpa_supplicant service or does dhcpcd automatically load it?
2016-01-13 23:09:02	duncaen	you can activate a hook in dhcpcd to start wpa_supplicant if its needed instead of using the wpa_supplicant service
2016-01-13 23:09:30	duncaen	ln -s /usr/share/dhcpcd/hooks/10-wpa_supplicant /usr/libexec/dhcpcd-hooks/
2016-01-13 23:09:52	duncaen	to activate the hook then you just need the dhcpcd service and have to remove the wpa_supplicant service
2016-01-13 23:10:13	devster31	thanks
2016-01-13 23:10:14	duncaen	i think thats a nicer solution because dhcpcd can see when the interface is unplugged or something

2016-01-13 23:44:25	duncaen	they changed it in the last release to not have to hook activated by default

2016-01-14 20:03:36	nat0	The void repos only have mesa built against nouveau, not nvidia340
2016-01-14 20:03:43	nat0	Not sure what to do with them...
2016-01-14 20:08:06	nat0	Hmm also looks like there's no virtualgl-32bit package available.
2016-01-14 20:28:20	nat0	Alright, installing bumblebee and nvidia both did some very strange things to my system.
2016-01-14 20:28:41	nat0	First of all, it broke xorg/cinnamon.  Which is to be expected.
2016-01-14 20:29:33	nat0	But it also pulled in linux-headers and other packages.  Booting after the install, my system was not able to properly mount its encrypted devices.  It seems something installed broke the device mapper.
2016-01-14 20:29:49	nat0	Instead they were mounted with UUIDs, and /usr was not happy about it.
2016-01-14 20:41:49	duncaen	oO
2016-01-14 20:42:01	duncaen	kernel headers are needed for dkms
2016-01-14 20:42:04	nat0	Yeah right?
2016-01-14 20:42:18	nat0	Yeah, dkms and some other stuff was brought in.
2016-01-14 20:42:36	nat0	I just purged everything that was installed and my GUI is still fscked.

2016-01-14 21:48:48	duncaen	/var/cache/xbps
2016-01-14 21:48:53	nat0	derpa derp
2016-01-14 21:58:19	nat0	Am I dense or shouldn't 'xbps-rindex -c /var/cache/xbps' remove all files for packages I've uninstalled?
2016-01-14 21:58:40	nat0	And if I'm forcably removing a package with xbps-remove, why doesn't it delete config directories and the like?
2016-01-14 21:59:21	duncaen	no
2016-01-14 21:59:29	duncaen	/var/cache/xbps is not a repository
2016-01-14 21:59:41	nat0	Okay, so I did misread that.
2016-01-14 21:59:51	duncaen	xbps-remove -O/--clean-cache
2016-01-14 22:00:11	nat0	Okay, i tried -O but didn't see the clean cache option.
2016-01-14 22:00:20	duncaen	-O is the same
2016-01-14 22:00:27	nat0	Is there a way to purge config and directories while uninstalling?
2016-01-14 22:00:30	duncaen	short/long
2016-01-14 22:00:35	nat0	Ah
2016-01-14 22:00:40	duncaen	yea -f normally
2016-01-14 22:00:56	nat0	Well, neither of those flags are doing either of those things for me. :\
2016-01-14 22:01:14	nat0	I've tried 'xbps-remove -fR' on my xorg and DE packages.
2016-01-14 22:01:25	nat0	But I still have /etc/X11 for example.
2016-01-14 22:01:42	nat0	And even after they were uninstalled, 'xbps-remove -Oo' didn't clear the packages from the cache.
2016-01-14 22:01:58	nat0	God I've belmed this up already. :\
2016-01-14 22:02:29	duncaen	there are multiple packages that put files into /etc/X11
2016-01-14 22:02:59	nat0	I imagine, but shouldn't a recursive and forceful removal clear those packages out as well?
2016-01-14 22:03:20	duncaen	xinit and xorg-server as example install both into /etc/X11
2016-01-14 22:03:27	duncaen	and they are not depending on each other
2016-01-14 22:03:36	nat0	I think I installed them both with xorg-minimal
2016-01-14 22:04:04	duncaen	then xbps-remove -R xorg-minimal should work
2016-01-14 22:07:24	nat0	It did remove the packages.  However it still left directories in /etc, /usr/share, etc.
2016-01-14 22:07:43	nat0	Meanwhile '-O' has left all those packages in /var/cache/xbps.
2016-01-14 22:07:57	nat0	I just want to literally purge every file and directory that were brought in by xorg and cinnamon.
2016-01-14 22:09:29	duncaen	hm -O removes obsolete ones, it probably means that if the version is older than whats currently in the repository, its safe to rm from /var/cache/xbps anyways nothing is indexed there xbos just looks if its there before downloading again
2016-01-14 22:11:11	nat0	That would make sense.
2016-01-14 22:14:05	nat0	Okay, I think I've got it.
2016-01-14 22:14:08	nat0	man baby man
2016-01-14 22:14:14	nat0	'-ff' removes config files
2016-01-14 22:14:39	nat0	and it looks like '-ffFR' is what's needed to purge everything.
2016-01-14 22:14:41	nat0	Trying now...
2016-01-14 22:22:51	nat0	Nope.
2016-01-14 22:23:13	nat0	Guess I'm wiping and re-installing everything.
2016-01-14 22:23:25	duncaen	no wouldn't do that
2016-01-14 22:24:25	duncaen	xbps-query -o '/etc/X11/*'
2016-01-14 22:30:04	nat0	Hmm apparently recursively purging xorg-minimal didn't actually remove xorg-server, or a few libX11* packages.
2016-01-14 22:35:11	duncaen	hm very strange, xbps-remove -Rn xorg-minimal doesnt remove xorg-server
2016-01-14 22:37:00	duncaen	nat0: its because something else depends on xorg-server too
2016-01-14 22:37:05	duncaen	xbps-query -X xorg-server
2016-01-14 22:42:07	nat0	Yeah, I manually removed any package containing any reference to xorg/X11/xf86/video/intel/nvidia.
2016-01-14 22:42:17	nat0	I confirmed all config and directories were purged.
2016-01-14 22:42:22	traeak	ugh didn't know that was a meta package
2016-01-14 22:42:39	nat0	Reinstalling it all, and Xorg continues to crash with an error that only started after installing nvidia the first time.

2016-01-14 22:44:10	nat0	Chanku: try selecting the correct locale and running this -
2016-01-14 22:44:17	nat0	xbps-reconfigure -f glibc-locales
2016-01-14 22:44:22	Chanku	How would I do that?
2016-01-14 22:44:38	nat0	Make sure /etc/locale.conf only contains "LANG=<your_locale>"
2016-01-14 22:44:53	nat0	And that the same locale is uncommented in /etc/default/libc-locales
2016-01-14 22:44:59	Chanku	alright...
2016-01-14 22:45:04	nat0	Then run the xbps-reconfigure command.

2016-01-14 22:45:57	duncaen	why?
2016-01-14 22:46:09	duncaen	i think of reinstallation as a timewaste
2016-01-14 22:46:16	nat0	I agree.
2016-01-14 22:46:17	mender27	duncaen, thanks for mentioning the thing with pulseaudio on the forums :)
2016-01-14 22:46:20	nat0	But I need an xorg-server.
2016-01-14 22:46:31	duncaen	mender27: which thing, cant remember
2016-01-14 22:46:48	mender27	duncaen: that pulseaudio is not a good idea on a desktop :D.
2016-01-14 22:47:36	mender27	duncaen: someone was trying to solve the 'default mute' thing with ALSA by installing pulseaudio.
2016-01-14 22:47:38	duncaen	ah the system wide service
2016-01-14 22:48:07	duncaen	i don't use pulse but i wouldn't say its bad for desktop
2016-01-14 22:48:17	duncaen	in some cases its just easier
2016-01-14 22:49:09	duncaen	the alsa thing should be fixed by activating the alsa service, that stores and restores the levels on boot and reboot respectively
2016-01-14 22:49:10	dominikh	and in some cases it's required
2016-01-14 22:49:45	dominikh	is there a solution for bluez 5 + alsa + bluetooth audio yet? seeing how bluez 5 got rid of its own audio stack/alsa plugin
2016-01-14 22:50:02	duncaen	but the system wide daemon is just bad and thats also what the pulse devs say
2016-01-14 22:50:49	duncaen	dont know, never had much fun with bluez
2016-01-14 22:51:09	dominikh	so yeah, unless that changed, you need PA if you want bluetooth audio now
2016-01-14 22:51:31	mender27	I read that Bluez 5 has only support for PA.
2016-01-14 22:51:52	duncaen	alsa plugins are very straight forward to write but i dont know about bluetooth
2016-01-14 22:51:57	mender27	It was pretty loud among the Slackware folks, because it forced the main dev to implement PA
2016-01-14 22:52:04	traeak	fun fun
2016-01-14 22:52:08	dominikh	well, bluez itself shouldn't care. it just doesn't support audio itself anymore. PA implements it, but so could another service.
2016-01-14 22:52:12	traeak	PA can murder performance
2016-01-14 22:52:20	mender27	Oh yes.
2016-01-14 22:53:38	mender27	Regarding bluetooth audio, there is this forum thread: https://forum.voidlinux.eu/t/no-bluetooth-audio-with-alsa-solved/184

2016-01-14 22:58:38	duncaen	yea i think it cant be cross compiled
2016-01-14 22:58:59	duncaen	you can compile it natively on your arm platform
2016-01-14 22:59:02	devster31	perl doesn't cross-compile, so I compiled it on arm
2016-01-14 22:59:08	duncaen	ah ok
2016-01-14 22:59:17	devster31	can't publish it? will save some time?

2016-01-14 23:09:26	mender27	I do sometimes use WINE
2016-01-14 23:10:28	mender27	The other reason was curiosity, because clamd and freshclamd run as systemd deamons and for instance on FreeBSD clamav complains that it cannot run the deamons :P.
2016-01-14 23:11:21	maldridge	I don't think anyone here runs it, thus no need to package it

2016-01-14 23:33:08	Chanku	:P
2016-01-14 23:33:31	Chanku	I mainly am writing it in python because it's easy to do quickly :\
2016-01-14 23:34:55	duncaen	seems dangerous and doesn't even reap zombies oO
2016-01-14 23:35:58	traeak	so runit lacks a dependency tree right ?
2016-01-14 23:37:23	duncaen	hm depends on how you know if the dependencie is up
2016-01-14 23:37:39	Chanku	The init does actually reap zombies (IIRC)
2016-01-14 23:37:47	duncaen	sv check $service || exit in run scripts is somehow like an automatic dependenie tree right?
2016-01-14 23:38:18	maldridge	its not so much a "tree" as it is a "keep thrashing until all your dependencies are up"
2016-01-14 23:38:28	Chanku	However it doesn't deal with process managers (you can use your own, or use Yet Another Process Manager (or Yet Another Init - Process Manager))
2016-01-14 23:38:29	maldridge	which usually only takes one cycle
2016-01-14 23:39:38	Chanku	(So eventually my init will not be using Python3)
2016-01-14 23:41:01	Chanku	And it works it seems :P
2016-01-14 23:41:10	duncaen	if there is no real way to notify if the service is up a dependencie tree is somehow useless
2016-01-14 23:41:35	Chanku	:\
2016-01-14 23:42:02	duncaen	https://github.com/mheily/relaunchd can do this with sockets, by preloading a library
2016-01-14 23:42:43	duncaen	systemd does it if you implement sd_notify or its a socket or dbus service
2016-01-14 23:43:20	duncaen	not sure if it only works if you use the sd_ socket api
2016-01-14 23:43:28	traeak	relaunchd:  JSON is used instead of XML
2016-01-14 23:43:45	duncaen	i think he wants to use libucl now
2016-01-14 23:44:33	duncaen	but i still think shell scripts are nicer and easiert for customization
2016-01-14 23:45:24	traeak	shell scripts are pretty much to the point
2016-01-14 23:45:25	duncaen	on the other hand, do i want a shell process for each service
2016-01-14 23:45:40	traeak	the exec makes it go away
2016-01-14 23:46:28	maldridge	I like shell scripts, they are closer to sysvinit
2016-01-14 23:46:55	traeak	so i consider the sh process to be very lightweight and very unixy
2016-01-14 23:47:32	duncaen	but sometimes its not needed at all
2016-01-14 23:47:39	mender27	Gotta go people. G'night!
2016-01-14 23:48:02	traeak	if true then soft link "run" directly to the executable right ?
2016-01-14 23:48:23	duncaen	minit does it nice for some things, run is just a link to your programm and a params file seperated by newlines is used as argv

2016-01-14 23:49:10	duncaen	maybe i just write a small run programm in c to just read a file and use its content for execve
2016-01-14 23:49:45	traeak	i think that's splitting hairs
2016-01-14 23:49:59	traeak	as in its not anything that's "bleeding"
2016-01-14 23:50:06	duncaen	but runnit passes some args to run and i want to pass my own args
2016-01-14 23:50:06	maldridge	traeak: probably don't want to symlink it, then you wouldn't get any args and the process would be running as root; probably not what you want
2016-01-14 23:50:28	maldridge	you also wouldn't get to control what directory you were in
2016-01-14 23:50:45	traeak	well he did mention if 'run' isn't needed.  i just assumed no setup required to run the executable
2016-01-14 23:51:49	duncaen	i want to implement it but at the end i would implement some config file for all features and then just using shell doesnt change that muchx D
2016-01-14 23:52:04	traeak	firing off a shell script to exec it isn't so bad
2016-01-14 23:52:20	traeak	and us old fogies understand 'sh' pretty well
2016-01-14 23:52:34	traeak	systemd does the file full of configuration thigs
2016-01-14 23:52:46	traeak	i'm not impressed, its more stuff to learn and screw up.
2016-01-14 23:52:57	traeak	mostly i can test a new service by just doing "./run"
2016-01-14 23:53:05	duncaen	yea i would like to count their unit keywords but dont know where to start xD
2016-01-14 23:53:15	traeak	that covers a lot of debug
2016-01-14 23:54:18	traeak	that's what i disliked most about systemd and openrc    debugging
2016-01-14 23:54:25	duncaen	i would like to write my own init/supervisor but runit is already very clever and i dont think i could to better
2016-01-14 23:54:36	duncaen	s/to/do
2016-01-14 23:54:52	Chanku	I personally prefer Epoch as an init :P
2016-01-14 23:55:07	traeak	so if there's a weakness its in handling dependencies
2016-01-14 23:55:10	traeak	and also i notice
2016-01-14 23:55:34	traeak	some of the linux service stuff like udev, polkit, etc add some complexity i don't know where to begin with those
2016-01-14 23:55:36	Chanku	(Although I will admit, I do have some preference to mine, as it's designed to be extremely modular so any part can be used elsewhere :P)
2016-01-14 23:57:26	duncaen	but python just throws you out of the game
2016-01-14 23:57:57	duncaen	then i would prefer sh
2016-01-14 23:59:01	Chanku	Why?
2016-01-14 23:59:14	Chanku	I mean it works....and honestly Python is better than sh in terms of readability....
2016-01-14 23:59:34	Chanku	(Although Python3 is less than optimal for a init, I will say that...)
2016-01-15 00:00:10	traeak	sh can get out of control quickly but the goal is to keep it simple
2016-01-15 00:00:15	duncaen	that would by my only argument, python is large and somehow uncontrollable
2016-01-15 00:00:19	traeak	and runit can use python as a launcher
2016-01-15 00:00:27	traeak	if you want to write your service in python go ahead
2016-01-15 00:00:38	duncaen	i dont want my init to randomly alocate memory
2016-01-15 00:00:41	traeak	it doesn't stop you
2016-01-15 00:00:46	duncaen	or garbage collecting
2016-01-15 00:00:47	Chanku	Alright.
2016-01-15 00:00:49	traeak	that's also why i don't like wicd
2016-01-15 00:01:03	Chanku	Honestly it works rather nice...and I wouldn't use it daily
2016-01-15 00:01:12	traeak	learning and proof of concept
2016-01-15 00:01:22	Chanku	Hm
2016-01-15 00:01:22	Chanku	?
2016-01-15 00:01:28	duncaen	try it on a server and test how many weeks it can run :D
2016-01-15 00:01:32	traeak	hacking your own init :-p
2016-01-15 00:01:40	Chanku	I don't even have a server...and i"m broke
2016-01-15 00:01:53	Chanku	:|
2016-01-15 00:01:58	traeak	you can use rpi2 as a server
2016-01-15 00:02:01	duncaen	get a raspberry pi and host it at home :)
2016-01-15 00:02:07	Chanku	I'm broke :\
2016-01-15 00:02:31	duncaen	steal something in your tourist hood

2016-01-15 00:02:57	traeak	even more money
2016-01-15 00:03:01	traeak	doh
2016-01-15 00:03:03	duncaen	yea sell yourself to an old unix administrator xD
2016-01-15 00:03:21	Chanku	:\
2016-01-15 00:03:49	maldridge	traeak: duncaen, perhaps a bit of a filter for socially acceptable statements?
2016-01-15 00:04:02	maldridge	especially statements with ambiguous meaning
2016-01-15 00:04:12	duncaen	its all fun
2016-01-15 00:04:29	Chanku	Although I generally have to say, the main thing is that I prefer about my init, is the way I have it setup. I don't think I have ran into an init with a similar architecture....
2016-01-15 00:04:58	nat0	fuck are we all supposed to have those filters??
2016-01-15 00:04:58	maldridge	Chanku: sometimes if you are writing something, and you can't find anything else like it, there's a very good reason
2016-01-15 00:05:19	Chanku	maldridge not necessarily....
2016-01-15 00:05:19	maldridge	nat0: yeah, xbps-install moral-compass
2016-01-15 00:05:26	duncaen	lol
2016-01-15 00:05:30	traeak	heh
2016-01-15 00:05:31	nat0	ew morals are gross...
2016-01-15 00:05:32	maldridge	just avoid repo3, it seems to be missing a ton of stuff...
2016-01-15 00:05:49	Chanku	I mean for mine, it's that I just split up everything into smaller programs
2016-01-15 00:05:56	maldridge	oh, and it doesn't build on musl, morals are only available on glibc
2016-01-15 00:06:01	Chanku	process supervision was placed under a separate process
2016-01-15 00:06:07	Chanku	init was placed in another
2016-01-15 00:06:12	traeak	considering the number of trash cheap arm boards out there
2016-01-15 00:06:16	duncaen	thats how most inits does it
2016-01-15 00:06:17	traeak	10 years ago there was nothing like this
2016-01-15 00:06:21	duncaen	except systemd
2016-01-15 00:06:38	Chanku	The init only got the system to the point of allowing it to run and runs the process manager....
2016-01-15 00:07:04	Chanku	and it also reboots the process manager...if there is none it drops you into a shell to do whatever you want/need
2016-01-15 00:07:05	devster31	guys, tmux is seriously broken on armv6hf-musl
2016-01-15 00:07:06	duncaen	this is how you init https://gist.github.com/rofl0r/6168719
2016-01-15 00:07:35	traeak	i paid almost 3000usd for my p5-120
2016-01-15 00:07:37	Chanku	Oh yeah I've heard of that....
2016-01-15 00:07:39	maldridge	devster31: bug report pls
2016-01-15 00:07:51	Chanku	(I also just wanted to get into system programming a bit :\)
2016-01-15 00:08:07	traeak	it's all good
2016-01-15 00:08:11	devster31	maldridge: I'm trying to build it from source, see if it fixes something, bugs are on github? void-packages?
2016-01-15 00:08:18	duncaen	yea dont worry its, trying out things to learn is the best thing you can do
2016-01-15 00:08:23	maldridge	duncaen: there was a rather long article about that, its pretty good
2016-01-15 00:08:55	maldridge	devster31: yes, file on https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/ and be sure to mention package, architecture, and libc
2016-01-15 00:09:13	duncaen	and maybe a backtrace
2016-01-15 00:10:52	duncaen	Chanku: http://git.suckless.org/sinit/tree/sinit.c too
2016-01-15 00:12:03	maldridge	suckless is a neat idea but has a poor choice in name
2016-01-15 00:12:03	Chanku	also heard of that
2016-01-15 00:12:51	duncaen	maldridge again about morals?
2016-01-15 00:13:37	nat0	isn't a moral a type of fruit?
2016-01-15 00:15:07	traeak	its too pessimistic
2016-01-15 00:15:55	duncaen	i think the opposit, they start to implement useless stuff and take bad decisions xD
2016-01-15 00:21:01	traeak	i mean name suckless

2016-01-15 00:22:57	traeak	so runit vs s6 hehe
2016-01-15 00:23:18	duncaen	hm this epoch init looks not so nice from source code view
2016-01-15 00:23:27	duncaen	https://github.com/Subsentient/epoch/tree/master/src
2016-01-15 00:23:34	duncaen	hate this coding style just by skimming
2016-01-15 00:24:07	traeak	so s6 has a notification system
2016-01-15 00:24:21	duncaen	and its a "sane" notification system
2016-01-15 00:24:29	duncaen	but somehow it also grows enormously
2016-01-15 00:24:53	duncaen	*compared to runit
2016-01-15 00:25:11	duncaen	*the s6 suit
2016-01-15 00:25:47	traeak	grows enormously?
2016-01-15 00:27:07	duncaen	yea its just init/supervision and has already ton of features
2016-01-15 00:27:17	duncaen	and he is constantly adding new features
2016-01-15 00:27:50	duncaen	but not a valid point, you dont have to use the features and everything is well seperated
2016-01-15 00:28:29	duncaen	never really played around with it
2016-01-15 00:28:52	duncaen	somehow s6-rc as sh replacement for run script is maybe good maybe bad idk
