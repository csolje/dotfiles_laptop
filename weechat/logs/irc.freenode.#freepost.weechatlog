2015-11-28 21:17:06	koz_	tane: I would recommend '21st Century C' as a book to read.
2015-11-28 21:17:19	koz_	It's actually very, *very* good, and explains a lot of things other textbooks leave out.
2015-11-28 21:17:43	tane	Yeah, is there a free online copy available?
2015-11-28 21:17:44	Calinou	I would recommend "The C++ Programming Language"
2015-11-28 21:17:52	Calinou	tane, torrents say yes
2015-11-28 21:18:03	tane	Meh
2015-11-28 21:18:34	tane	well, I usually just type into google "Index of /" + programming to land on some strange chinese sites with tons of book-rips :)
2015-11-28 21:19:18	Calinou	qBittorrent has a nifty built-in search engine
2015-11-28 21:19:58	tane	i prefer not to use bittorrent
2015-11-28 21:21:22	Calinou	use a VPN?

2015-11-29 00:04:38	Calinou	nevermind
2015-11-29 00:05:19	JamesJRH	Then tomorrow I'm going to go on this one in Wolverhampton, which is about 45 minutes away by train: https://secure.avaaz.org/en/event/globalclimatemarch/Clean_Energy_Global_Climate_March
2015-11-29 00:05:32	JamesJRH	That one will be *much* bigger!!! :-D
2015-11-29 00:06:56	JamesJRH	pizzaiolo: It's about the UN climate summit in Paris starting on Monday and lasting a fortnight, and trying to raise awareness that they need to act upon sustainability issues: http://globalclimatemarch.org/en/
2015-11-29 00:07:07	ic2000	JamesJRH: that's around an hour drive from where i live
2015-11-29 00:07:11	◀▬▬	Calinou (~Calinou@unaffiliated/calinou) has quit (Quit: Calinou)
2015-11-29 00:07:43	pizzaiolo	JamesJRH: awesome
2015-11-29 00:08:41	JamesJRH	ic2000: Do you live in Britain too?
2015-11-29 00:08:48	ic2000	JamesJRH: ye
2015-11-29 00:10:10	JamesJRH	ic2000: There'll probably be a closer one anyway. There are thousands around the world. It's pretty much every city plus some towns and other places too.
2015-11-29 00:11:02	ic2000	JamesJRH: wait what we talking about? thousands of what?
2015-11-29 00:11:20	JamesJRH	Thousands of individual marches! :-D
2015-11-29 00:11:29	JamesJRH	This thing is fucking massive!
2015-11-29 00:12:21	JamesJRH	http://350.org/global-climate-march/
2015-11-29 00:12:23	ic2000	JamesJRH: marches for what
2015-11-29 00:12:23	fpbot	“350.org – Global Climate March is happening now!”
2015-11-29 00:12:31	JamesJRH	It's run by 350.org.
2015-11-29 00:12:54	JamesJRH	The Global Climate March.
2015-11-29 00:13:18	JamesJRH	For the UN climate summit this next fortnight.
2015-11-29 00:13:36	ic2000	JamesJRH: meh, don't really care. people dying all round the world, manual labour is going on and all sorts yet no one acknowledges it 
2015-11-29 00:14:07	JamesJRH	Well, I'm trying to help make the world better.
2015-11-29 00:14:14	JamesJRH	I can only try.
2015-11-29 00:14:23	JamesJRH	And contribute.
2015-11-29 00:15:52	ic2000	many people are getting massacred in palestine, syria, iraq and no one acknowledges it. 100 people die in paris, oh no it's a tragedy the world has never seen 
2015-11-29 00:16:10	JamesJRH	Y:-(
2015-11-29 00:16:15	JamesJRH	:-(
2015-11-29 00:16:25	JamesJRH	Yeah, it's crazy.
2015-11-29 00:16:33	Jookia	Ah, the whole 'there are bigger problems' fallacy
2015-11-29 00:16:42	ic2000	i'm not saying what happened in paris was little
2015-11-29 00:17:00	ic2000	ofc it was bad, and we should sympathize for them. but there needs to be some balance
2015-11-29 00:17:37	ic2000	which is why i made this http://flagfilter.bitballoon.com/ but it's a shit program
2015-11-29 00:17:42	ic2000	as i don't know javascript
2015-11-29 00:17:43	Jookia	who decides what's balanced
2015-11-29 00:17:47	ic2000	i just yolo'd it
2015-11-29 00:17:53	ic2000	the definiton of the word does
2015-11-29 00:17:57	JamesJRH	The Parisian authorities banned the Paris climate march that was going to happen at the end of the summit.
2015-11-29 00:18:10	JamesJRH	I was thinking of going to it.
2015-11-29 00:18:26	ic2000	having a minute of silence for the death of around 100 people, and then having nothing at all for the many thousands dying across the world is stupid
2015-11-29 00:18:48	Jookia	ic2000: why?
2015-11-29 00:19:02	JamesJRH	I was really pissed-off when I saw the news a fortnight ago because I knew that that would have implications on the march.
2015-11-29 00:19:07	ic2000	i'm not replying to retarded questions, sorry
2015-11-29 00:19:24	Jookia	ic2000: then don't ask them
2015-11-29 00:19:33	JamesJRH	I was even more pissed-off when I heard that the march was outright *banned* in Paris.
2015-11-29 00:19:42	ic2000	sorry, and when did i ask a question?
2015-11-29 00:19:54	ic2000	and if i did it was rhetorical 
2015-11-29 00:19:59	JamesJRH	I thought that it'd just be difficult, not banned.
2015-11-29 00:20:10	ic2000	and even if it wasn't rhetorical i wasn't specifically talking to you
2015-11-29 00:20:18	Jookia	ic2000: why are you so mad at me for asking a question
2015-11-29 00:20:23	pizzaiolo	Jookia: don't feed trolls
2015-11-29 00:20:31	pizzaiolo	Jookia: also, follow @ioerror :O
2015-11-29 00:20:34	pizzaiolo	:P *
2015-11-29 00:20:39	Jookia	pizzaiolo: you're right i guess
2015-11-29 00:21:01	ic2000	Jookia: i'm not being mad, but if u can't see why it's a problem then there's no point in me talking to you
2015-11-29 00:21:11	JamesJRH	23:17:00 < ic2000> ofc it was bad, and we should sympathize for them. but there needs to be some balance  ← I agree with this. Also, I was completely not scared of going to Paris after I heard the news. I was worried that the authorities would be heavy-handed.
2015-11-29 00:21:15	ic2000	and pizzaiolo i'm not trolling, if that's the case simply ban me
2015-11-29 00:21:39	ic2000	i have better things to do than troll today, perhaps another day when i'm not busy i will
2015-11-29 00:22:06	Jookia	ic2000: I see it's a problem but I disagree as to why it is. You're comparing apples to oranges. Ongoing war is different to a shooting, one's ongoing and one's quick and over.
2015-11-29 00:22:12	JamesJRH	I'm not scared of terrorists anymore than I'm scared of roads, and I travel on roads almost daily.
2015-11-29 00:22:18	ic2000	Jookia: death is death
2015-11-29 00:22:24	ic2000	there's no difference, all death is bad
2015-11-29 00:22:33	ic2000	it doesn't matter if it's death by war, or death by shooting
2015-11-29 00:22:34	Jookia	ic2000: There's a difference in how we respond to it
2015-11-29 00:22:41	ic2000	and the death i was talking about wasn't just war
2015-11-29 00:23:10	ic2000	e.g there are innocent Palestinians dying due to war crimes, not just soldiers
2015-11-29 00:23:14	ic2000	don't be so blind
2015-11-29 00:23:35	Jookia	Honestly I don't care about whatever's happening in the middle east
2015-11-29 00:23:59	ic2000	my point exactly
2015-11-29 00:24:06	ic2000	double standard 
2015-11-29 00:24:11	Jookia	Double standard?
2015-11-29 00:24:11	ic2000	could even be classed as racism
2015-11-29 00:24:20	JamesJRH	23:20:23 < pizzaiolo> Jookia: don't feed trolls  ← ic2000 isn't trolling. They had a fair point. The media is biased basically.
2015-11-29 00:24:24	Jookia	It's not that I care about what happens to the people at paris either
2015-11-29 00:24:33	Jookia	I don't even know what happened, I didn't read the news
2015-11-29 00:24:48	pizzaiolo	JamesJRH: ic2000 is always on this channel picking up fights with everyone
2015-11-29 00:24:54	pizzaiolo	calling people names etc
2015-11-29 00:25:05	ic2000	Jookia: well the way u phrased it looked like you were specifically talking about not caring for people in the middle east
2015-11-29 00:25:06	ic2000	Jookia: sorry
2015-11-29 00:25:13	Jookia	ic2000: no problem
2015-11-29 00:25:23	pizzaiolo	JamesJRH: not the most pleasant fellow
2015-11-29 00:25:32	ic2000	pizzaiolo: i did it once or twice, doesn't mean i always will
2015-11-29 00:25:54	Jookia	ic2000: your flag thing is nonfree
2015-11-29 00:26:24	ic2000	pizzaiolo: i used to be a fellow, happy member of this channel. but regardless i shouldn't of done what i did but hey we all make mistakes
2015-11-29 00:26:39	ic2000	Jookia: i'll be honest with you, i've stopped caring
2015-11-29 00:26:47	ic2000	as long as it does what i want i'm fine
2015-11-29 00:26:53	Jookia	ic2000: stop caring about freedom?
2015-11-29 00:26:59	JamesJRH	pizzaiolo: I've seen ic2000 say some silly and annoying things, yes, but that wasn't one of them. It was a fair point. The media throws things incredibly out of proportion.
2015-11-29 00:27:31	JamesJRH	Especially regarding war, which is *very* worrying.
2015-11-29 00:27:42	ic2000	Jookia: not completely but for stuff like this yeah
2015-11-29 00:27:46	JamesJRH	Basically the mainstream media is corrupt.
2015-11-29 00:27:52	Jookia	JamesJRH: All media is 'corrupt'
2015-11-29 00:27:58	ic2000	Jookia: my programs i make will be open source and free for anyone to do what they like with it
2015-11-29 00:28:07	Jookia	ic2000: neato
2015-11-29 00:28:08	ic2000	but it doesn't mean i'm gonna use free software
2015-11-29 00:28:22	ic2000	JamesJRH: well said
2015-11-29 00:28:41	Jookia	i find it surprising people believe that's any form of media that isn't 'corrupt'
2015-11-29 00:29:48	JamesJRH	:-(
2015-11-29 00:30:09	JamesJRH	I think that it's hard to find.
2015-11-29 00:30:18	skinnay	Jookia: what is a "flag thing"
2015-11-29 00:30:21	ic2000	some media isn't, even if it's rare
2015-11-29 00:30:22	ic2000	http://flagfilter.bitballoon.com/
2015-11-29 00:30:30	ic2000	it's a crap program i made
2015-11-29 00:30:35	Jookia	skinnay: it's the weird nonfree thing that ic2000 made
2015-11-29 00:30:41	Jookia	ic2000: which isn't corrupt?
2015-11-29 00:30:53	ic2000	like i said, i don't know javascript nor pixi js i just looked at an example code
2015-11-29 00:31:13	ic2000	Jookia: don't know anything specifically but looking at the chances i think i'm safe to say that
2015-11-29 00:31:20	Jookia	chances?
2015-11-29 00:32:04	ic2000	Jookia: why is it weird?
2015-11-29 00:32:17	ic2000	it's a quite a good idea, many people on FB came to me asking to make custom flag filters for them
2015-11-29 00:32:27	Jookia	ic2000: i dunno, i have no idea what it actually does
2015-11-29 00:32:30	ic2000	so i decieded to make a quick little program to do it for me
2015-11-29 00:32:44	ic2000	i forgot, u guys don't use facebook
2015-11-29 00:32:51	ic2000	basically there's this trend going on
2015-11-29 00:33:00	ic2000	where facebook has added a france flag filter
2015-11-29 00:33:07	ic2000	which goes over your profile picture
2015-11-29 00:33:17	JamesJRH	I don't have any particular news source that I recommend, anymore. I don't have much time for news either though, so I haven't dug anything out that seems to avoid bias.
2015-11-29 00:33:20	ic2000	so i decided to make a program so u can pick ur own flag
2015-11-29 00:33:33	Jookia	interesting
2015-11-29 00:34:06	pizzaiolo	this program is actually interesting
2015-11-29 00:34:16	pizzaiolo	it would be cool to have it freely licensed
2015-11-29 00:34:27	pizzaiolo	also, not SaaSS
2015-11-29 00:34:30	Jookia	pizzaiolo: i'm pretty sure you could just use imagemagick to do the same
2015-11-29 00:34:46	pizzaiolo	hmm not familiar with it
2015-11-29 00:34:49	pizzaiolo	but I believe you
2015-11-29 00:35:17	ic2000	pizzaiolo: it has no license but do what u want with it
2015-11-29 00:35:20	Jookia	i was having a discussion with myself this morning about permissive licenses and why people choose them
2015-11-29 00:35:45	JamesJRH	I think that the thing with corruption is that new little organisations have a /chance/ of starting-off with good intent, and then as time passes and they become bigger, they have an accumulating chance that they'll become corrupt.
2015-11-29 00:35:46	pizzaiolo	ic2000: according to our copyright laws, 'no license' means all rights reserved to you
2015-11-29 00:36:28	ic2000	pizzaiolo: tbh it's not even an official program or anything so it shouldn't really matter. i mean i can put it under a license if u really want but why would it matter if i give all of yall permission? 
2015-11-29 00:36:36	ic2000	besides the code isn't exactly complex lol
2015-11-29 00:36:46	ic2000	all u gotta do is resize the flag to the same size of the image
2015-11-29 00:36:50	ic2000	change the alpha of it 50
2015-11-29 00:36:52	ic2000	and boom
2015-11-29 00:37:16	pizzaiolo	ic2000: just put it on a repo on https://notabug.org/, and choose a free license
2015-11-29 00:37:18	Jookia	JamesJRH: even if you set up an organization to do some news, it's news biased towards your organization
2015-11-29 00:37:50	JamesJRH	Jookia: Yeah, but not necessarily corrupt.
2015-11-29 00:38:02	JamesJRH	Also, bias varies even then.
2015-11-29 00:38:21	ic2000	pizzaiolo: i can, but do u actually want it? if not i see no point cos i doubt anyone would wanna use it or it's source
2015-11-29 00:38:22	Jookia	JamesJRH: hence 'corrupt' in quotes, what is corruption versus bias?
2015-11-29 00:38:36	pizzaiolo	ic2000: maybe someone would
2015-11-29 00:38:48	JamesJRH	Some organisations actively try to avoid biasing towards themselves; others actively try to manipulate towards themselves.
2015-11-29 00:39:03	pizzaiolo	it's good practice to publish and freely license everything you write
2015-11-29 00:39:06	Jookia	JamesJRH: this is true, but it's still biased altogether since you can't report about everything from every view point ever
2015-11-29 00:39:06	ic2000	maybe, but if that's the case i might aswell just remake it in js without a library so it's fully free
2015-11-29 00:40:23	Jookia	I'm 90% sure the MIT license trend is a corporate propaganda
2015-11-29 00:40:28	JamesJRH	Jookia: Yep, I get where you're coming from.
2015-11-29 00:40:52	JamesJRH	I think that there must be a way to solve this.
2015-11-29 00:41:04	pizzaiolo	Jookia: how so?
2015-11-29 00:42:10	Jookia	pizzaiolo: github pushes it pretty hard, it's kinda a bad license, and an impression is created that there's kinda three options: proprietary, permissive, GPL
2015-11-29 00:42:15	JamesJRH	Science uses random sampling to avoid bias without having to sample an entire population.
2015-11-29 00:42:56	Jookia	JamesJRH: random news?
2015-11-29 00:43:06	JamesJRH	I don't know.
2015-11-29 00:43:12	JamesJRH	It's interesting.
2015-11-29 00:43:18	JamesJRH	I'll think about this.
2015-11-29 00:43:56	JamesJRH	But I should also write-up my manifesto sampling technique.
2015-11-29 00:44:11	JamesJRH	Actually, I've already written that up.
2015-11-29 00:44:36	ic2000	this is sick http://click.pocoo.org/5/
2015-11-29 00:45:13	Jookia	ic2000: nice!
2015-11-29 00:45:18	JamesJRH	I'd just need to polish it a bit then republish it on a site that's not affiliated with other political views.
2015-11-29 00:45:51	JamesJRH	I published it on the forum of the party that I'm a member of, the Pirate Party.
2015-11-29 00:46:32	JamesJRH	https://community.pirateparty.org.uk/discussion/139/randomly-sample-manifestos-to-avoid-bias

2015-11-29 00:54:51	JamesJRH	That just pisses me off.
2015-11-29 00:54:57	JamesJRH	I spent ages on that.
2015-11-29 00:55:03	ic2000	woah, apparently this is common on linux https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format
2015-11-29 00:55:30	JamesJRH	Then they have to go and screw it up with some forum update. >:-(
2015-11-29 00:55:47	JamesJRH	(It wasn't like that after posting at the time.)
2015-11-29 00:58:28	JamesJRH	Jookia: Btw., I can probably get by without Haskell on NixOS on ARM, at least to begin with.
2015-11-29 00:58:53	Jookia	JamesJRH: Woo
2015-11-29 00:59:05	JamesJRH	I'll get Gitit to export a static site and host it using a different webserver.
2015-11-29 00:59:22	JamesJRH	I need to publish loads of goods things that I've done.
2015-11-29 01:01:15	JamesJRH	Btw., the democracy stuff will be separated from the rest of my site. It will not have any navigation to articles not directly related to democracy.
2015-11-29 01:01:25	JamesJRH	I find that important.
2015-11-29 01:01:37	Jookia	Why
2015-11-29 01:02:20	JamesJRH	Democracy is an issue that I hold above all others, because it is our ability to make collective decisions on other issues.
2015-11-29 01:02:53	JamesJRH	The main site will have navigation to the democracy stuff, but not vice versa.
2015-11-29 01:04:09	JamesJRH	I'll only have a link to the homepage of the main site, rather than navigation to all of the various other parts of the main site.
2015-11-29 01:05:39	JamesJRH	Also, its theme will be either greyscale or multicoloured.
2015-11-29 01:05:55	JamesJRH	Probably multicoloured. :-)
2015-11-29 01:06:05	Jookia	ah
2015-11-29 01:06:25	JamesJRH	Greyscale is a bit bland.

2015-11-29 01:17:16	JamesJRH	I'm also pondering how to properly randomise colour.
2015-11-29 01:17:41	JamesJRH	Colourspaces vary.
2015-11-29 01:18:17	JamesJRH	I think that I'll just go for HSV and not worry about such detail.
2015-11-29 01:19:51	JamesJRH	Maybe there's a better way of selecting random colours, but I'll think of that in the future. I'm splitting hairs with that really as it probably has hardly any effect anyway.

2015-11-29 01:32:50	JamesJRH	hello.
2015-11-29 01:34:43	JamesJRH	Jookia: Do you know to run an ARM virtual machine in Virtual Machine Manager? I want to see if I can start getting something going with my BeagleBone Black.
2015-11-29 01:35:04	Jookia	JamesJRH: unsure
2015-11-29 01:35:21	JamesJRH	Jookia: Also, will it be the same? Any ARMv7-A will do, right?
2015-11-29 01:35:59	Jookia	depends on your goal/kernel
2015-11-29 01:37:18	JamesJRH	Stuff compiled for the Novena will work on the BeagleBone Black will work on the PandaBoard ES will work on the BeagleBoard X15, vice versa, etc. etc.?
2015-11-29 01:37:47	Jookia	if you use the right architecture in gcc it should yeah
2015-11-29 01:37:55	Jookia	see platforms.nix
2015-11-29 01:37:57	JamesJRH	I think that the PandaBoard ES is currently the most powerful ARM device that I have which is feasible to install NixOS onto.

2015-11-29 01:41:08	JamesJRH	I've had it for like over a year I think.
2015-11-29 01:41:16	JamesJRH	It's a shame, really.
2015-11-29 01:41:38	JamesJRH	I've never had the courage to try if I could get NixOS onto it.
2015-11-29 01:42:08	Jookia	It's not that hard if you know a bit of programming
2015-11-29 01:42:20	JamesJRH	I wonder if it'll boot straight out of the box.

2015-11-29 01:53:33	JamesJRH	Okay it only has a green LED showing.
2015-11-29 01:54:08	Jookia	Hmm?
2015-11-29 01:54:31	JamesJRH	No HDMI output or anything.
2015-11-29 01:54:55	JamesJRH	I don't even know whether anything is preloaded on the PandaBoard ES.
2015-11-29 01:54:55	Jookia	stock SD card image?
2015-11-29 01:55:30	JamesJRH	The BeagleBone Black just boots straight out of the box.
2015-11-29 01:56:16	JamesJRH	The PandaBoard ES has an SD card slot, maybe I need to load something onto an SD card and boot from that.

2015-11-29 11:54:32	xd1le	psyq: just add a new remote
2015-11-29 11:54:52	xd1le	so if it's a completely new repo, usually you add an 'origin' remote:
2015-11-29 11:55:09	xd1le	git remote add origin https://notabug.org/username/reponame
2015-11-29 11:55:12	xd1le	sorry
2015-11-29 11:55:20	xd1le	should be
2015-11-29 11:55:23	xd1le	git remote add origin https://notabug.org/username/reponame.git
2015-11-29 11:55:25	xd1le	i think
2015-11-29 11:56:00	xd1le	then you can do `git push -u origin <branchname>` to push to it and track it
2015-11-29 11:56:13	xd1le	so that you only need to do `git push` subsequently
2015-11-29 11:56:30	xd1le	usually the default branch name is 'master'
2015-11-29 11:57:08	xd1le	if you already have an origin remote at github (check .git/config), then just add it under a different name
2015-11-29 11:57:35	xd1le	i.e. git remote add notabug https://notabug.org/username/reponame.git
2015-11-29 11:58:14	xd1le	after which you would do `git push -u origin notabug` if you want to make `git push` default to push to notabug
2015-11-29 11:58:27	psyq	thanks xd1le 
2015-11-29 11:58:38	xd1le	sorry i meant `git push -u notabug <branchname>`
2015-11-29 11:59:12	xd1le	or you would just do `git push notabug <branchname>` otherwise if you want to keep `git push` behaviour to what you had before
2015-11-29 11:59:30	xd1le	(probably it pushes to origin, which might already be the repo at github)

2015-11-29 12:04:27	psyq	xd1le: is it possible to create a new repo from the commandline?
2015-11-29 12:13:59	xd1le	psyq: not that i know of
2015-11-29 12:14:17	xd1le	but it's not much from notabug.org, you just create a new empty repo
2015-11-29 12:14:31	xd1le	and then from the cli, git init wherever you want your project
2015-11-29 12:14:39	xd1le	add your files
2015-11-29 12:14:50	xd1le	git add and git commit them
2015-11-29 12:15:23	xd1le	then you can push your commit(s) by first adding a remote that points to the notabug repo as described above
2015-11-29 12:16:06	xd1le	and then just `git push -u origin master` to 'track' origin remote's master branch
2015-11-29 12:16:25	xd1le	(assuming you added notabug as the origin remote)
2015-11-29 12:19:57	psyq	okie coz I am not able to add the remote repo
2015-11-29 12:20:35	xd1le	psyq: github actually has the same instructions here: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

2015-11-29 12:21:02	psyq	numb mistake hahahaa
2015-11-29 12:21:10	xd1le	psyq: you might need to do `git remote add origin https://notabug.org/username/reponame.git`
2015-11-29 12:21:15	xd1le	note the .git at the end
2015-11-29 12:21:27	xd1le	github repos though usually don't need that i think.
2015-11-29 12:21:51	psyq	github need that too
2015-11-29 12:21:52	psyq	:)
2015-11-29 12:21:58	zPlus	create a new repo on NAB. You can either init it with a README file, or use "git init" and add NAB as a remote
2015-11-29 12:22:05	xd1le	psyq: btw, all `git remote add` does is edit the .git/config file for you
2015-11-29 12:22:44	xd1le	so cat .git/config before doing `git remote add ...` and then cat it after to see what it added for you
2015-11-29 12:22:54	xd1le	if you edited that by hand, it would have the same effect

2015-11-29 13:00:22	xd1le	psyq: yes you can have multiple remotes
2015-11-29 13:00:36	xd1le	so you can have one remote point to notabug, and another to github
2015-11-29 13:00:56	xd1le	but you'd need to git push twice, once to each remote

2015-11-29 15:00:07	fr33domlover	zPlus, i can try making a patch for an image viewer if you like
2015-11-29 15:00:21	turtleman_	fr33domlover i just pushed
2015-11-29 15:00:22	zPlus	fr33domlover: the GUI is indeed very simple, but using gnunet api not so much (that's why I'm making this thing, so that it will be a lot easier to use)
2015-11-29 15:01:12	fr33domlover	zPlus, gnunet in general seems to be too academic style: no good documentation, very little use despite all the advanced features it provides...

2015-11-29 16:53:19	fr33domlover	Calinou, this is actually a very good question worth discussing
2015-11-29 16:53:36	fr33domlover	it's a chance for you to explain
2015-11-29 16:55:35	fr33domlover	(although your answer may differ at lot from mine)
2015-11-29 17:04:27	pizzaiolo	The OP is PureTryOut, who is unsympathetic to free software
2015-11-29 17:04:38	pizzaiolo	uses 'open source' when convenient or kool
2015-11-29 17:15:25	zPlus	his initial assumption of "built-in anti-cheat systems in the client" is completely wrong, so there's no way to give an answer to that question....
2015-11-29 17:22:18	fr33domlover	zPlus, in that case the answer could explain that
2015-11-29 17:33:53	fr33domlover	koz_, speaking of haskell over-tooling - a few days ago a pure Haskell implementation of the Tor protocol has been released :P
2015-11-29 17:36:35	fr33domlover	Maybe I should stop reading Haskell news, it tempts me back into that world...

2015-11-30 01:13:34	turtleman_	fr33domlover not yet
2015-11-30 01:13:37	turtleman_	its just beginning
2015-11-30 01:13:44	fr33domlover	turtleman_, but software fish are modeled after real fish...
2015-11-30 01:14:08	turtleman_	yeah but they still arent real
2015-11-30 01:15:02	fr33domlover	turtleman_, of course they aren't. I mean what is being represented
2015-11-30 01:15:22	turtleman_	you think it sheds a positive light on aquarium fish?
2015-11-30 01:16:14	turtleman_	im thinking of how i can get around that
2015-11-30 01:16:29	fr33domlover	turtleman_, a society in which fish are free would never think about making an aquarium simulation... so yes, clearly the simlation exists because it's based on reality - bad reality which ought to be fixed :)
2015-11-30 01:16:45	fr33domlover	you can make the game about their release
2015-11-30 01:17:01	fr33domlover	like, they start in the box and you can gradually let them free
2015-11-30 01:17:08	turtleman_	but i want to take care of them and feed them
2015-11-30 01:17:24	fr33domlover	turtleman_, would you like to be fed though like a child?
2015-11-30 01:17:39	fr33domlover	neither do fish.... they are adults which eat by themselves :P
2015-11-30 01:18:09	fr33domlover	and young fish are probably fed by their parents
2015-11-30 01:18:16	fr33domlover	much like human children are
2015-11-30 01:27:57	turtleman_	i am just saying that i may enjoy taking care of these virtual animals without endorsing the practice
2015-11-30 01:35:44	fr33domlover	turtleman_, if you enjoy caring and want to avoid endorsing the pracive, I think you should change them from fish to something else. Something that doesn't suggest instrumentalism. Hmmm perhaps some kind of robots (that don't look like fish) or endangered dolphins which need your help before they can be returned to nature safely :P
2015-11-30 01:36:15	fr33domlover	or just turn them into some imaginary animal
2015-11-30 01:36:27	turtleman_	ill think about it
2015-11-30 01:36:29	fr33domlover	that doesn't look like a real animal abused by humans :P
2015-11-30 01:38:31	turtleman_	what if the fish were rescued and need help
2015-11-30 01:43:30	fr33domlover	possible, but this is a special case: for fish, the commonly known case is being in an aquarium until death, for people's random pleasure, and that's what players will think about when they see your game :/
2015-11-30 01:43:40	fr33domlover	even if you tell them otherwise
2015-11-30 01:44:57	fr33domlover	i gave the dolphin example because that's more widely known as a thing human do with dolphins (although humans also hunt dolphins for selfish pleasure... i dunno how commonly in western society though)
2015-11-30 01:50:36	turtleman_	hmm ok i will think about what to do
2015-11-30 01:55:13	fr33domlover	:)

2015-11-30 23:12:52	vaeringjar	so the reply, "There are many obvious ways how [propietary] games could attempt to stop cheating..." basically admits they know nothing about encryption or peer review

2015-12-01 20:50:31	skinnay_mobile	I got a computer for 25 bucks at a blowout sale, and I'm using that just to do my homework on, so I don't have to have flash on my main machine
2015-12-01 20:50:39	JamesJRH	SylvieLorxu: Are you not allowed to use Virtual Machine Manager? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Machine_Manager
2015-12-01 20:51:16	JamesJRH	I use it as a frontend to Qemu.
2015-12-01 20:55:04	SylvieLorxu	JamesJRH: I need to run Visual Studio
2015-12-01 20:56:40	JamesJRH	francis7: I've just remembered something. Although I always said LibreBoot right from the start, because I knew the word ‘libre’ and had heard of Coreboot, that wasn't the case for Coreboot. I first read it as ‘CoReboot’, and was reading it like that to begin with.
2015-12-01 20:57:56	zPlus	SylvieLorxu: why did they disable your account?
2015-12-01 20:58:02	JamesJRH	francis7: I can't remember for how long though, probably somewhere between a few hours to a few weeks.
2015-12-01 20:58:18	SylvieLorxu	zPlus: No clue
2015-12-01 20:58:23	SylvieLorxu	I have been given 0 info
2015-12-01 20:58:57	JamesJRH	There was no obvious indication that it should be read ‘CoreBoot’.
2015-12-01 20:59:10	zPlus	SylvieLorxu: is that one of those msdna accounts?
2015-12-01 21:00:31	JamesJRH	Actually, I think that I'll start saying ‘CoreBoot’ instead of ‘Coreboot’ from now on. Readability matters more than stylisation.
2015-12-01 21:02:25	 *	JamesJRH would like to see a libre education movement.
2015-12-01 21:03:16	JamesJRH	In fact I believe that that's essential.
2015-12-01 21:03:42	JamesJRH	The question is how.
2015-12-01 21:06:54	JamesJRH	MSDNA? Uuwhhhrrr! No thanks!!! :-(
2015-12-01 21:08:19	JamesJRH	I don't particularly like the idea of LibreDNA, though, either. :-/
2015-12-01 21:09:18	 *	JamesJRH is against genetic modification while wars exist.
2015-12-01 21:10:04	JamesJRH	When there is world peace, I'd probably be okay with the idea.
2015-12-01 21:10:15	JamesJRH	Same goes for IoT.
2015-12-01 21:10:40	turtleman_	im thinking of creating an RP forum on freepost
2015-12-01 21:10:48	turtleman_	where people can RP-by-post
2015-12-01 21:11:12	JamesJRH	RP?

2015-12-01 21:11:36	JamesJRH	Ah.
2015-12-01 21:12:22	turtleman_	hmm it probably doesnt work well with a nested-reply layout
2015-12-01 21:12:57	turtleman_	maybe this would be better on GNU social
2015-12-01 21:19:20	SylvieLorxu	zPlus: Kinda yes-no?
2015-12-01 21:19:33	SylvieLorxu	Microsoft doesn't know itself either
2015-12-01 21:20:02	SylvieLorxu	I'm not kidding, when I login it always first tells me it can't find my account, but then logs me in anyway
2015-12-01 21:20:22	zPlus	ah nice
2015-12-01 21:21:14	zPlus	luckily they're not managing banks' logins :)
2015-12-01 21:21:54	JamesJRH	Lol.
2015-12-01 21:21:59	JamesJRH	They probably are though.
2015-12-01 21:22:04	JamesJRH	:-(
2015-12-01 21:23:45	JamesJRH	SylvieLorxu: So you're using that Microsoft crap so that you can do your college assignments, and obviously you're not at college to learn proprietary crap, you're there to get the qualifications, right?
2015-12-01 21:23:53	JamesJRH	That was the case for me.
2015-12-01 21:24:46	SylvieLorxu	Well, yes, but frankly, dropping out would cause way more trouble than just staying causes
2015-12-01 21:25:10	JamesJRH	I had to do assignment about proprietary software. Education-wise, this was pointless. The only reason that I did it was for the qualifications, which I don't value anyway now.
2015-12-01 21:25:13	JamesJRH	:-(
2015-12-01 21:25:31	JamesJRH	assignments*
2015-12-01 21:25:55	SylvieLorxu	Based on your usage history (€4.77/day), you might use your remaining credit in about 9 days.
2015-12-01 21:25:57	SylvieLorxu	Wuuut
2015-12-01 21:25:59	SylvieLorxu	I barely use Azure
2015-12-01 21:26:04	SylvieLorxu	How am I using 5 Euro a day
2015-12-01 21:26:26	SylvieLorxu	...Because I didn't shut down the VM that runs Visual Studio
2015-12-01 21:26:28	SylvieLorxu	Okay.
2015-12-01 21:26:42	JamesJRH	:-(
2015-12-01 21:26:59	 *	JamesJRH hates SaaS!
2015-12-01 21:27:01	zPlus	SylvieLorxu: did you have to pay as well? Or are they money that MS gave you?
2015-12-01 21:27:28	JamesJRH	You mean college?
2015-12-01 21:27:31	SylvieLorxu	Azure is such bullshit
2015-12-01 21:27:40	SylvieLorxu	zPlus: I'm not paying for this myself, no
2015-12-01 21:27:58	zPlus	SylvieLorxu: probably your uni tuitions did XD
2015-12-01 21:29:00	Calinou	JamesJRH, I'd rather use Google Slides than Microsoft Office
2015-12-01 21:29:04	Calinou	(this is what I'm doing right now btw)
2015-12-01 21:29:07	Calinou	the reasons:
2015-12-01 21:29:09	Calinou	- gratis
2015-12-01 21:29:11	Calinou	- works on GNU/Linux
2015-12-01 21:29:14	Calinou	Office is neither.
2015-12-01 21:29:29	Calinou	of course, I shouldn't do it
2015-12-01 21:29:32	JamesJRH	Is it libre?
2015-12-01 21:29:34	Calinou	no
2015-12-01 21:29:35	Calinou	:)
2015-12-01 21:29:44	Calinou	but well, they (at uni) don't want to hear about LibreOffice
2015-12-01 21:29:44	JamesJRH	Well then.
2015-12-01 21:29:54	JamesJRH	So.
2015-12-01 21:31:12	JamesJRH	At least gratis proprietary software is better than paid proprietary software because you avoid funding the development of it.
2015-12-01 21:32:35	koz_	Hi all. What did I miss?
2015-12-01 21:34:07	SylvieLorxu	I got locked out of a Microsoft account for a few hours and had trouble regaining access because Microsoft can't write working systems and gave me error messages all the time until I retried it like 20 times
2015-12-01 21:35:12	koz_	Micro$atan can't software. News at 11.
2015-12-01 21:35:20	JamesJRH	Nongratis libre software is the missing corner of the quadrangle. Proprietary software doesn't deserve funding; libre software does.
2015-12-01 21:36:19	JamesJRH	Proprietary software should be unfunded, and just die. Libre software has to have better funding models.

2015-12-01 21:37:29	francis7	JamesJRH, you need to sometimes live a bit dangerously to make progress
2015-12-01 21:37:41	francis7	and installing libreboot on your X60 has few risks, the images are well-tested
2015-12-01 21:37:42	JamesJRH	Re.?
2015-12-01 21:37:42	SylvieLorxu	On that note, I find it kinda amusing Vesta is selling license codes, with 0 proprietary code
2015-12-01 21:37:46	zPlus	s/sometimes/always
2015-12-01 21:37:46	francis7	and you'll have me helping you install it

2015-12-01 21:37:57	francis7	just ping me whenever you want, and I'll help you install it
2015-12-01 21:38:15	zPlus	SylvieLorxu: a license... for what?
2015-12-01 21:38:16	francis7	you always were a bit over cautious at times
2015-12-01 21:38:29	francis7	it's good to be cautious, but there are also balances
2015-12-01 21:38:36	JamesJRH	Yep.
2015-12-01 21:38:37	francis7	bad risk vs acceptable risk
2015-12-01 21:38:41	koz_	francis7: I actually wanted to ask - Does the FSF gift-giving guide EUR100 discount apply to the flashing service as well as the preflashed machines?

2015-12-01 21:38:57	francis7	koz_, it doesn't apply to the flashing service
2015-12-01 21:39:08	koz_	Ah. Well, thanks for clearing that up.

2015-12-01 21:39:20	francis7	actually, it might do
2015-12-01 21:39:24	francis7	let me check my config
2015-12-01 21:40:07	francis7	ah ha
2015-12-01 21:40:12	francis7	koz_, nope. it does apply
2015-12-01 21:40:25	francis7	koz_, you can get the discount on that service. meh. I'll just leave it that way I guess
2015-12-01 21:40:46	francis7	I don't see the harm. I don't get many customers on that anyway, most people just get the ones that are already flashed
2015-12-01 21:40:54	koz_	Alrighty. I'll likely be sending my laptop your way, then.
2015-12-01 21:41:09	koz_	I just need to get my scholarship funds paid to me.
2015-12-01 21:41:20	francis7	cool
2015-12-01 21:41:34	francis7	shipping between NZ<>UK also isn't too bad
2015-12-01 21:42:04	Calinou	<JamesJRH> Proprietary software should be unfunded, and just die.
2015-12-01 21:42:09	Calinou	students usually understand that, don't worry :)
2015-12-01 21:42:12	Calinou	except for games…
2015-12-01 21:42:27	JamesJRH	No.
2015-12-01 21:42:33	JamesJRH	Including games.
2015-12-01 21:42:37	Calinou	in my group (15 people), we are 2 to pay for Adobe
2015-12-01 21:42:39	francis7	IMO games are mostly irrelevant. the engine should be free
2015-12-01 21:42:51	francis7	the artwork I don't care about, as long as it's freely redistributable
2015-12-01 21:42:51	JamesJRH	Games are dangerous in this respect.
2015-12-01 21:42:58	Calinou	francis7, talking about that, did you hear, Warsow 2.0 has liberated most assets under CC BY-SA 4.0? and the rest (only a few) are only CC BY-ND 4.0
2015-12-01 21:43:02	francis7	artwork/music/textures/maps/etc
2015-12-01 21:43:04	Calinou	this means Warsow is now redistributable, even commercially
2015-12-01 21:43:05	Calinou	and most of it is libre
2015-12-01 21:43:07	Calinou	(engine is GPLv2°
2015-12-01 21:43:13	Calinou	it was released yesterday
2015-12-01 21:43:20	francis7	I'm happy to accept a game where the engine is GPLv3 but the art is CC-BY-ND
2015-12-01 21:43:37	SylvieLorxu	francis7: You clearly know more than me, mind adding a reply to http://freepo.st/community/FreeGaming/post/kg2jms9m/Warsow%20releases%202.0%20with%20relicensed%20assets ?
2015-12-01 21:43:38	koz_	francis7: It represents a huge step forward from the current defacto standard.
2015-12-01 21:43:47	francis7	SylvieLorxu, clearly?

2015-12-01 21:44:01	SylvieLorxu	Whoops
2015-12-01 21:44:07	koz_	Which is 'we'll copyright the shit out of everything and go after you with fire-breathing lawyers on vague charges'.
2015-12-01 21:44:09	francis7	yeah, I don't know anything about gaming
2015-12-01 21:44:16	francis7	haven't really gamed since I was about 18 tbh
2015-12-01 21:45:48	JamesJRH	francis7: My interest in libre artwork started with realising the threat of proprietary games dictating the platform. If you support libre artwork then the whole ‘games as an artform’ thing does not excuss them to be proprietary! ;-)
2015-12-01 21:45:59	Calinou	I posted a comment
2015-12-01 21:46:08	francis7	JamesJRH, I only care about the engine
2015-12-01 21:46:22	francis7	eg graphics/physics/sound/scripting engine
2015-12-01 21:46:31	francis7	the rest I couldn't care less about
2015-12-01 21:46:38	SylvieLorxu	Calinou: Thanks
2015-12-01 21:46:52	francis7	non-functional data isn't important, but that ought to be freely redistributible
2015-12-01 21:46:57	JamesJRH	20:43:21 < francis7> I'm happy to accept a game where the engine is GPLv3 but the art is CC-BY-ND  ← Yeah, this is not too bad, but long-term, I'm against that too.
2015-12-01 21:47:07	Calinou	those assets are required to play
2015-12-01 21:47:08	Calinou	I'll note it
2015-12-01 21:47:14	francis7	obviously, I'd prefer the art to be free too
2015-12-01 21:47:23	francis7	documentation should also always be free
2015-12-01 21:47:25	koz_	JamesJRH: I basically see it as a step in the right direction.
2015-12-01 21:47:45	JamesJRH	Short-term, I'm not that bothered about CC BY-ND and such, and may even release things under that myself under certain conditions.
2015-12-01 21:47:47	Calinou	francis7, yes, free documentation allows for things like https://devdocs.io

2015-12-02 22:14:22	JamesJRH	fr33domlover: But the thing about Darcs is that I don't understand how it's possibly safe.

2015-12-02 22:15:15	JamesJRH	How can you possibly test all of that?
2015-12-02 22:15:54	JamesJRH	With Git, I know that each and every one of my commits is working, unless I mark it with ‘WIP’.
2015-12-02 22:16:34	JamesJRH	If you want to cherrypick then you have to be careful and check that you're not breaking anything.
2015-12-02 22:17:05	fr33domlover	JamesJRH, i'm not very familar with darcs patch theory
2015-12-02 22:17:16	JamesJRH	But with Darcs, it seem like there's no difference between cherrypicking and pulling.
2015-12-02 22:18:10	JamesJRH	So it has a partial order – does that mean that I can explicitly specify dependency of patches?
2015-12-02 22:18:48	JamesJRH	Partial order effectively means that it's a DAG, doesn't it.
2015-12-02 22:22:20	koz_	JamesJRH: Correct.

2015-12-02 22:52:38	JamesJRH	“Why the set-of-patches view is useful” and “Why the sequence-of-patches view is useful”.
2015-12-02 22:53:21	JamesJRH	I see, so the ‘set-of-patches view’ is an optional way of looking at it which makes pretty much buggerall sense to me.
2015-12-02 22:54:22	JamesJRH	“The set-of-patches way of understanding your darcs repository is useful because it avoids you thinking about the work Darcs is doing behind the scenes to detect and to preserve patch dependencies. Your primary focus can be whether or not Darcs allows you to add/remove patches to a set, and not so much why.
2015-12-02 22:54:27	JamesJRH	If you’re interested in why, then the sequence-of-patches way of understanding things becomes useful.”
2015-12-02 22:54:50	JamesJRH	Yep, I definitely prefer the ‘sequence-of-patches view’.
2015-12-02 22:55:53	JamesJRH	“As far as Darcs is concerned, all repositories are just sequences of patches.”  ← Ha, so it's also how Darcs sees it. :-P
2015-12-02 22:56:55	JamesJRH	Also, the whole implicit dependency thing isn't so bad because further down I see a heading “Explicit dependencies”. :-)
2015-12-02 22:59:20	JamesJRH	“On a more practical level, the sequence-of-patches viewpoint gives you an approximation of your repository history. It’s not an exact representation because Darcs allows patches to be reordered, but it’s good enough to get a rough sense of when things happened.”  ← fr33domlover: Hmm, do patches not have timestamps?
2015-12-02 23:00:36	fr33domlover	JamesJRH, they do have timestamps
2015-12-02 23:00:49	fr33domlover	`darcs log` shows roughly what `git log` shows
2015-12-02 23:01:59	JamesJRH	Why does that say that it's only approximate then?

2015-12-03 21:00:25	JamesJRH	It has wasted at least 12 hours.
2015-12-03 21:00:45	JamesJRH	Probably over 15.
2015-12-03 21:01:59	JamesJRH	And because it's so slow and can't multitask without something seemingly going wrong, I have to keep prompting it. Like I download each folder individually incase it paddies on me.
2015-12-03 21:02:37	JamesJRH	And during the long waits while it does that, I get distracted and lose even more time.

2015-12-03 22:25:19	vaeringjar	I think I feel some of seagull's pain about it, but I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone for buying a galaxy s2 and loading it up. 
2015-12-03 22:25:44	koz_	The thing is, we didn't get fully-free computers overnight.
2015-12-03 22:26:06	koz_	However, I wouldn't have told people pre-Libreboot to just not buy them at all, especially from sellers who support their parent project.
2015-12-03 22:26:18	koz_	It strikes me as a bit self-defeating.

2015-12-03 22:29:24	koz_	Since Nouveau doesn't carry game-specific code and *shouldn't* do so.
2015-12-03 22:29:36	koz_	To say nothing of disabling multithreading on it means your CPU will get *hammered*.
2015-12-03 22:30:10	 *	koz_ mutters something about moral bankruptcy again.
2015-12-03 22:32:05	Calinou	yeah, NVIDIA driver has tons of game-specific benchmark optimizations (aka. cheating)
2015-12-03 22:32:17	koz_	Yup, because game programmers in the proprietary world can't code.
2015-12-03 22:32:20	koz_	Or optimize.
2015-12-03 22:32:26	koz_	This is neither news nor surprising.
2015-12-03 22:32:28	Calinou	cheating is common in the land of benchmarks
2015-12-03 22:32:33	Calinou	Samsung was caught with their BenchmarkBooster "app"

2015-12-03 22:33:20	koz_	Oh yeah, Calinou - my Nouveau-powered 680 can get 25fps on Impossible settings in StuntRally.
2015-12-03 22:33:26	koz_	(fullscreen on 1920x1080 res).

2015-12-03 22:34:58	koz_	Is that separate from the graphics settings?
2015-12-03 22:35:07	Calinou	yes, it's not affected by graphics presets
2015-12-03 22:35:12	Calinou	try using anti-aliasing set to 4
2015-12-03 22:35:14	koz_	Ah. I'll have to check that actually.

2015-12-03 22:36:00	koz_	I'm kinda amazed, actually.

2015-12-03 22:37:29	pizzaiolo	hey koz_
2015-12-03 22:37:42	Calinou	this will get nowhere anyway, only generate hatred towards free software advocates
2015-12-03 22:37:42	koz_	Given who it is, they'll run screaming from anything that *looks* like GPL.
2015-12-03 22:37:42	pizzaiolo	Calinou: :P
2015-12-03 22:37:51	Calinou	koz_, you should never use "full" view range
2015-12-03 22:37:53	Calinou	it's basically infinite
2015-12-03 22:37:59	Calinou	use something like 256, which is good already
2015-12-03 22:38:04	koz_	Calinou: Even not on full, I top out at like 40.
2015-12-03 22:38:05	Calinou	(server doesn't really send more)
2015-12-03 22:38:10	pizzaiolo	Calinou: I'm hoping some website picks this up as news
2015-12-03 22:38:14	Calinou	also 512 textures are very RAM-heavy
2015-12-03 22:38:25	Calinou	pizzaiolo, Phoronix? "Free Software Faggets Complain About Swift License"?
2015-12-03 22:38:28	pizzaiolo	GPL debates are always valid, people can learn new things
2015-12-03 22:38:29	Calinou	how contributing to our cause…
2015-12-03 22:38:30	koz_	Calinou: You mean card memory or actual memory?
2015-12-03 22:38:33	Calinou	koz_, both
2015-12-03 22:38:43	koz_	Calinou: I've checked my RAM load, and it's not that high.
2015-12-03 22:38:51	koz_	I guess my card's memory might be the limiting factor here.
2015-12-03 22:38:57	koz_	680s only have 3G IIRC.
2015-12-03 22:39:00	koz_	Or maybe even just 2G.
2015-12-03 22:39:06	pizzaiolo	I don't mind being portrayed negatively, the important is that people know what the message is
2015-12-03 22:40:51	koz_	Also, pizzaiolo: Moosader's stuff will be merged into awesome-gamedev once I actually have confirmation of licenses.
2015-12-03 22:40:55	koz_	Currently, I've merged all I can.
2015-12-03 22:41:07	pizzaiolo	cool
2015-12-03 22:41:19	pizzaiolo	she usually hangs out at ##esperanto
2015-12-03 22:41:30	pizzaiolo	I'll try to talk to her whenever I can
2015-12-03 22:41:46	koz_	Well, if you could, as a fellow Esperanteur, let her know that she has about a zillion pending license questions, I would be very much obliged. :P
2015-12-03 22:42:04	pizzaiolo	lol
2015-12-03 22:42:10	pizzaiolo	she's seen them
2015-12-03 22:42:14	pizzaiolo	she pinged me about it
2015-12-03 22:42:19	pizzaiolo	like 'I see what you did there'
2015-12-03 22:42:31	pizzaiolo	but I'm guessing IRL stuff is going on
2015-12-03 22:43:04	koz_	I figured I'd ask.
2015-12-03 22:43:19	koz_	I think I'm second to Calinou for being a license nuisance. :P
2015-12-03 22:43:35	pizzaiolo	heh, I always do it too
2015-12-03 22:43:43	pizzaiolo	that's what my github account is for
2015-12-03 22:43:54	koz_	Yeah, mine also. Well, that and bug reports etc.
2015-12-03 22:44:15	koz_	I still keep the living redirect of awesome-c up, but I've been thinking whether it's worth having it there.
2015-12-03 22:44:35	pizzaiolo	yesterday I made a bug report called "port to GNU/Linux" lol
2015-12-03 22:44:39	koz_	LOL.
2015-12-03 22:44:51	koz_	I'm actually tempted to blog about Swift going free - and why I think it makes zero difference.
2015-12-03 22:44:52	pizzaiolo	like, 'redo your whole thing'
2015-12-03 22:44:57	pizzaiolo	but it was too good to pass on
2015-12-03 22:45:19	pizzaiolo	it's an live wallpaper of real-time openstreetmap edits 
2015-12-03 22:45:37	koz_	Was it implemented in Micro$atan language
2015-12-03 22:45:39	koz_	?
2015-12-03 22:45:46	pizzaiolo	no, for OS X
2015-12-03 22:45:53	pizzaiolo	koz_: you should write about it
2015-12-03 22:45:58	pizzaiolo	I'll share it around
2015-12-03 22:46:26	koz_	I'll do so.
2015-12-03 22:47:15	pizzaiolo	koz_: check it out https://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/ (javascrippled link)
2015-12-03 22:49:15	koz_	pizzaiolo: OK.
2015-12-03 22:55:11	koz_	Let's hope this post is coherent.

2015-12-03 23:42:03	pizzaiolo	awesome
2015-12-03 23:42:12	koz_	It's fairly modest as far as my articles usually go.
2015-12-03 23:42:19	pizzaiolo	I love saying 'awesome' in a new zealand accent
2015-12-03 23:42:37	pizzaiolo	AUWL-sum
2015-12-03 23:42:38	koz_	Lol.
2015-12-03 23:43:05	koz_	It's only about 1500 words, but hopefully it gets my point across.
2015-12-03 23:43:58	SylvieLorxu	koz_: In all honesty, nouveau is reverse-engineered so clearly has bugs
2015-12-03 23:44:11	SylvieLorxu	A lack of multithreading support causing Warsow to crash isn't Warsow's fault really
2015-12-03 23:44:17	SylvieLorxu	Also, it works just fine :P
2015-12-03 23:44:55	koz_	SylvieLorxu: Funny how *literally no other game on Nouveau* has this problem with multithreading.
2015-12-03 23:45:03	koz_	Kinda suggests to me that it's a problem with Warsow, not Nouveau.
2015-12-03 23:45:20	koz_	(in any case, Nouveau should have nothing to do with this)
2015-12-03 23:45:57	◀▬▬	dimkr (~dima@unaffiliated/dimkr) has quit (Quit: dimkr)
2015-12-03 23:46:16	SylvieLorxu	I don't know if the others games I listed even do multithreading
2015-12-03 23:46:25	koz_	SylvieLorxu: I can assure you that they do.
2015-12-03 23:46:42	koz_	I've been doing a *lot* of resource monitoring of games recently.
2015-12-03 23:46:55	SylvieLorxu	Must I remind you that nouveau locks up between 1 and 5 times a day under normal use, even without gamingL
2015-12-03 23:46:59	SylvieLorxu	Clearly, nouveau has bugs
2015-12-03 23:47:02	pizzaiolo	I haven't yet tried Warsow, did you like it SylvieLorxu?
2015-12-03 23:47:26	SylvieLorxu	pizzaiolo: It's fairly fun. Bit complicated, but they added a tutorial in 2.0 so that helped me actually understand it
2015-12-03 23:47:27	koz_	SylvieLorxu: On your card, yes. I agree Nouveau has bugs, but this is *definitely* a Warsow issue AFAICT.
2015-12-03 23:48:21	SylvieLorxu	koz_: Well, I'll happily suggest configuration settings you suggest, perhaps we can nail it down to something else than multithreading
2015-12-03 23:48:27	SylvieLorxu	Hell, the forum topic has a backtrace, so...
2015-12-03 23:48:30	koz_	Also, out of sheer interest, what's your card according to lspci?
2015-12-03 23:48:36	SylvieLorxu	Should probably report that to the nouveau people
2015-12-03 23:48:38	koz_	Let me read said backtrace actually.
2015-12-03 23:48:56	SylvieLorxu	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF116 [GeForce GTX 550 Ti] (rev a1)
2015-12-03 23:49:13	koz_	Huh. Interesting.
2015-12-03 23:50:55	koz_	Userspace driver gets some action in that trace.
2015-12-03 23:50:58	koz_	(well, DDX driver rather)
2015-12-03 23:51:19	koz_	I actually suspect this is a libc issue if anything.
2015-12-03 23:51:57	koz_	It actually amuses me that the guy jumped to the conclusion it's Nouveau's fault when it really doesn't seem that way.
2015-12-03 23:52:06	koz_	What's your glibc version?
2015-12-03 23:53:48	pizzaiolo	koz_: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/duplicates/3vca80/on_swift_freedom_and_not_one_fuck_was_given/
2015-12-03 23:54:01	pizzaiolo	so that you can control it
2015-12-03 23:54:55	SylvieLorxu	koz_: idk
2015-12-03 23:55:04	SylvieLorxu	I'm just a webdev, koz
2015-12-03 23:55:08	SylvieLorxu	I'm not good with computer
2015-12-03 23:55:24	koz_	SylvieLorxu: Is this on your Gentoo machine?
2015-12-03 23:55:34	koz_	If so, doesn't it have a way to check installed package versions?
2015-12-03 23:55:42	koz_	This could actually be quite relevant.
2015-12-03 23:56:20	SylvieLorxu	It probably has a way to do that
2015-12-03 23:56:43	koz_	Well, if you ever have the time and/or inclination to figure this out, I'd appreciate it.
2015-12-03 23:57:01	koz_	pizzaiolo: Thanks for posting it!
2015-12-03 23:57:06	pizzaiolo	no worries
2015-12-03 23:57:09	pizzaiolo	I'm reading it now
2015-12-03 23:57:40	SylvieLorxu	Well, I have to get up in 6 hours and 30 minutes
2015-12-03 23:57:51	SylvieLorxu	And tomorrow is going to be fairly nerve-wrecking
2015-12-03 23:57:52	SylvieLorxu	So not now :P
2015-12-03 23:57:55	SylvieLorxu	Remind me later? :P
2015-12-03 23:58:18	koz_	SylvieLorxu: You can bet that I will.
2015-12-03 23:58:28	koz_	I might actually install Warsow myself and see if I can replicate this.
2015-12-03 23:58:52	SylvieLorxu	Do make sure to get the new 2.0 release
2015-12-03 23:59:01	SylvieLorxu	1.5.1 had no issues
2015-12-03 23:59:17	koz_	Yeah, I'm looking into grabbing its sauce.
2015-12-03 23:59:59	SylvieLorxu	Why not just grab the binaries? Compiling is such a waste of time
2015-12-04 00:00:15	koz_	SylvieLorxu: I don't mind sauce builds.
2015-12-04 00:00:30	koz_	Mmmm, sauce.
2015-12-04 00:00:42	koz_	Regardless, I'll have to do it from my other machines, because I can't do this download over SSH.
2015-12-04 00:00:46	SylvieLorxu	I was expecting some "says the Gentoo user" comment, so I could do #thatsthejoke but oh well
2015-12-04 00:00:48	koz_	At least, not in any way I know of.
2015-12-04 00:00:52	koz_	Eh.
2015-12-04 00:01:06	SylvieLorxu	There's this handy tool called wget
2015-12-04 00:01:09	SylvieLorxu	Don't know if you heard of it
2015-12-04 00:01:10	koz_	I sling enough low blows in your direction as it is - adding one more would be ungentlemanly. :P
2015-12-04 00:01:21	koz_	SylvieLorxu: How would I wget from the Warsow site exactly?
2015-12-04 00:01:35	koz_	I'm not being facetious - I *genuinely* wanna know how one would do this.
2015-12-04 00:01:45	SylvieLorxu	"wget https://www.warsow.gg/download?dl=warsow20sdk" I'd think
2015-12-04 00:02:14	koz_	Hmm, that seems to be doing its thing.
2015-12-04 00:02:20	koz_	I'll have to remember that one.
2015-12-04 00:02:41	SylvieLorxu	What? That wget uses URLs to download things from?
2015-12-04 00:02:58	koz_	No - that I can do stuff like this with download links.
2015-12-04 00:03:15	SylvieLorxu	Well, that depends
2015-12-04 00:03:16	 *	koz_ is too used to just git cloning or whatever.
2015-12-04 00:03:36	SylvieLorxu	If it's a Sourceforge link, you can't, because that URL is an actual downloadable HTML page that uses JS to redirect you
2015-12-04 00:03:45	SylvieLorxu	But if the server redirects instead, wget will just follow that
2015-12-04 00:03:51	koz_	How can I tell which it is?
2015-12-04 00:07:02	SylvieLorxu	If you give the url to wget and you end up getting an HTML page downloaded, it's the first one
2015-12-04 00:07:12	SylvieLorxu	I really don't think there's another way
2015-12-04 00:07:20	koz_	I see. I will keep that in mind, thanks!
2015-12-04 00:07:32	koz_	TIL, as the cool kids say.
2015-12-04 00:07:36	SylvieLorxu	Well, you can probably use another tool to see if the server redirects at all, but why bother?
2015-12-04 00:07:49	SylvieLorxu	Perhaps it's not actually a redirect and the original is valid too
2015-12-04 00:08:07	SylvieLorxu	Just wget and rm if it's some dumb HTML thing and curse the site for being stupid :P
2015-12-04 00:08:11	koz_	Lol.
2015-12-04 00:08:30	koz_	I'll add it to my list of things requiring cursing for their stupidity.
2015-12-04 00:08:47	SylvieLorxu	Hmm, I should go to bed
2015-12-04 00:08:50	SylvieLorxu	But I don't feel like going to bed
2015-12-04 00:08:54	SylvieLorxu	Even though I have to get up soon
2015-12-04 00:08:57	SylvieLorxu	Ugh.
2015-12-04 00:08:57	koz_	A common problem.
2015-12-04 00:09:23	SylvieLorxu	I stayed up until like 2AM yesterday to care for a friend over chat who was having an anxiety attack x.x
2015-12-04 00:09:40	SylvieLorxu	And thus my attempt to get my rhythm in order gradually for tonight got messed up
2015-12-04 00:09:46	SylvieLorxu	Still, worth it, caring for people is important
2015-12-04 00:10:26	koz_	Yeah - a person is worth more than a night of sleep.
2015-12-04 00:11:27	SylvieLorxu	Indeed
2015-12-04 00:12:01	koz_	Weird - wget seems to have fetched me an unextractable archive, lol.
2015-12-04 00:12:28	SylvieLorxu	"tar -xzvf filename" doesn't work?
2015-12-04 00:12:29	koz_	W/e, I'll just download it the hard way by wandering over to my machine 2 metres away. :P
2015-12-04 00:12:33	koz_	SylvieLorxu: Nope.
2015-12-04 00:12:35	SylvieLorxu	wget seems to not rename files
2015-12-04 00:12:36	SylvieLorxu	Huh.

2015-12-04 22:24:42	vaeringjar	going well. digesting freepost posts. you?
2015-12-04 22:25:19	koz_	Something similar.
2015-12-04 22:25:29	koz_	Also trying to debug a Haskell program without much luck.
2015-12-04 22:25:39	koz_	It's behaving strangely and I have no clue why.
2015-12-04 22:28:40	vaeringjar	argh sucks
2015-12-04 22:29:09	koz_	Might need to have one of our Haskellers have a look at it - I'm stumped.
2015-12-04 22:29:21	vaeringjar	what program?
2015-12-04 22:29:42	koz_	vaeringjar: Data structure implementation for my PhD research.

2015-12-04 22:54:38	tane	how are you doing?
2015-12-04 22:54:51	koz_	I'm pretty good - in the middle of some Haskell debugging.
2015-12-04 22:54:56	koz_	Although I've localized the issue.

2015-12-04 23:41:04	pecg	You seem more eloquent though, so you will be a much reloaded prototype

2015-12-04 23:44:48	koz_	I've got a big blog post in the pipeline, but it requires a lot of thought which I can't give it just yet.
2015-12-04 23:45:43	pecg	I'm still thinking about wether or not publish some of my writings, considering the fact the majority of them carry lots of straight forward criticism about politics in my country
2015-12-04 23:45:55	ic2000	 why did i delete linux
2015-12-04 23:45:59	pecg	And here saying those kind of thinks out loud could be dangerous
2015-12-04 23:46:21	pecg	I mean, really dangerous
2015-12-04 23:46:59	pecg	I guess I will take a chance, after all if me or own my family members gets in danger, exile seems like a good option

2015-12-04 23:49:50	tane	interesting article :)
2015-12-04 23:49:58	koz_	tane: Glad you think so. :)
2015-12-04 23:50:04	pecg	I'm from Honduras
2015-12-04 23:50:09	koz_	pecg: Ah, I see.
2015-12-04 23:50:15	tane	It's rather harshly though
2015-12-04 23:50:18	pecg	Have you heard of it/
2015-12-04 23:50:23	koz_	Yeah - Murrica's not helped political situations in any part of that world.
2015-12-04 23:50:33	koz_	tane: Eh, I'm usually pretty harsh.
2015-12-04 23:50:35	pecg	Murrica?
2015-12-04 23:50:38	koz_	pecg: USA.
2015-12-04 23:50:43	tane	and comparing function pointers to higher-order functions of a functional language is pretty much over the top :)
2015-12-04 23:51:00	koz_	It's a semi-common derisive nickname for the USA.
2015-12-04 23:51:18	pecg	tane: but pointers to function in C give the language high-order function capabilities
2015-12-04 23:51:18	koz_	tane: Yeah, well, I exaggerate in places, true, but the thrust of my overall argument is that Swift brings nothing new to the table.
2015-12-04 23:51:29	koz_	And I believe that it makes the critique valid, if a bit overblown.
2015-12-04 23:51:43	tane	yeah, your point is still valid :)
2015-12-04 23:52:14	pecg	USA has done lots of pain spreading their famous 'democracy'
2015-12-04 23:52:21	tane	pecg, as assembly language provides capabilities for higher order subroutines :)
2015-12-04 23:52:37	koz_	pecg: Yeah - but South and Central America have felt it harder than many.
2015-12-04 23:52:42	pecg	But that will be a topic worth writing about in an article
2015-12-04 23:52:50	koz_	And they haven't stopped - fucking NAFTA.
2015-12-04 23:53:16	pecg	koz_: School of the Americas (with a different name these days)
2015-12-04 23:53:50	pecg	Military governments, cup d'etats and related things
2015-12-04 23:53:56	koz_	Yeah, and NAFTA.

2015-12-04 23:56:24	koz_	turtleman_: That term, lol.
2015-12-04 23:56:37	tane	koz_, regarding swift, and many other single-implementation languages there's this kind of centralistic community approach. I do not yet know what to think of it. It just crosses my mind now and then.
2015-12-04 23:57:21	koz_	tane: Well, the thing is, this has ups and downs.
2015-12-04 23:57:35	koz_	A perfect example of a *bad* decentralized (i.e. standards-based) language is Scheme.
2015-12-04 23:57:52	tane	is scheme ISO standardized?
2015-12-04 23:58:00	koz_	There's a *lot* of divergence in implementations, which makes their individual languages almost-incompatible dialects which require a lot of pain to interop.
2015-12-04 23:58:12	koz_	tane: It's standardised in several places.
2015-12-04 23:58:27	koz_	I dunno if there's an ISO standard Scheme, but I know that there are several standards.
2015-12-04 23:58:35	tane	so they all have those language extensions and a minimal denominator?

2015-12-04 23:58:48	tane	yeah..
2015-12-04 23:59:18	tane	what I don't like about these single-implementation languages is, that .. you write some softwar and three years later nothing compiles anymore, sometimes even earlier
2015-12-05 00:00:28	tane	writing C feels like hammering something into stone, it's hard at first but stays a long time :)
2015-12-05 00:00:32	koz_	tane: It's *very* minimal.
2015-12-05 00:00:50	koz_	This is true - but C is very much the exception for standards compliance.
2015-12-05 00:01:02	koz_	(and even then it's far from perfect - fucking Micro$atan)
2015-12-05 00:01:14	tane	haha, why?
2015-12-05 00:01:21	tane	gnu's rolling their own extensions
2015-12-05 00:01:47	koz_	Because Micro$atan are stuck at C89.
2015-12-05 00:01:53	koz_	While the rest of the world are using C11 already.
2015-12-05 00:02:05	tane	yeah, they've been focusing on c++,  strange enough
2015-12-05 00:02:17	koz_	Even their C++ support is full of caveats.
2015-12-05 00:02:30	koz_	Like, they *claim* to support C++14, but there's so many ifs and buts there, it might as well not be the case.
2015-12-05 00:02:54	koz_	So fact is, while centralized langs do have downsides, standardized ones aren't necessarily better.
2015-12-05 00:04:02	tane	yeah, we'll see what happens with swift then
2015-12-05 00:04:14	koz_	tane: My guess? Crapple proprietary extensions.
2015-12-05 00:04:20	koz_	Like with Clang.
2015-12-05 00:04:35	tane	well, my first guess would be, that due to lack of any real novelty the hipstertrain will depart soon enough
2015-12-05 00:04:52	tane	even happens when things are too new (see rust)
2015-12-05 00:05:52	turtleman_	SylvieLorxu: what about it do you find confusing?
2015-12-05 00:05:57	turtleman_	it should be in your notifications area
2015-12-05 00:06:35	SylvieLorxu	turtleman_: More of the "What do you want to play" without having a setting? :P
2015-12-05 00:07:02	turtleman_	what do you mean?
2015-12-05 00:07:05	turtleman_	its a cliche fantasy setting
2015-12-05 00:07:13	koz_	turtleman_: Not everyone's a DnD player. :P
2015-12-05 00:07:14	turtleman_	do you know anything about tolkein, or d&d universe
2015-12-05 00:07:18	koz_	tane: Probably.
2015-12-05 00:07:22	SylvieLorxu	koz_: Wanna know something ironic?
2015-12-05 00:07:28	SylvieLorxu	turtleman_: Not at all >.<
2015-12-05 00:07:29	koz_	Frankly, the hipster train runs on JS rails.
2015-12-05 00:07:56	koz_	This is why the NodeJS libraryverse is so full of reinvented wheels, they could probably make a *million* trains now.
2015-12-05 00:08:10	turtleman_	have you played video games with magic and non-human species and stuff?
2015-12-05 00:08:51	SylvieLorxu	turtleman_: I guess
2015-12-05 00:08:56	SylvieLorxu	Ryzom probably counts
2015-12-05 00:09:00	SylvieLorxu	Also sorry, I'm a tiny bit busy
2015-12-05 00:09:10	SylvieLorxu	I just broke a production PHP app by implementing an error handler

2015-12-05 00:36:06	SylvieLorxu	As a result, the application crashes constantly
2015-12-05 00:36:24	SylvieLorxu	If you register your own error handler, PHP has this sane default where it'll start considering warnings errors too
2015-12-05 00:36:29	SylvieLorxu	And call your error handler for that as well
2015-12-05 00:36:49	kl3	I'm pretty sure that's not supposed to be ;)
2015-12-05 00:38:35	SylvieLorxu	On the plus side, this way I'll finally get to fixing this shoddy codebase

2015-12-05 01:03:17	koz_	Slight difference.

2015-12-05 01:03:59	SylvieLorxu	Link?
2015-12-05 01:04:09	koz_	(it's to do with OpenGL contexts from multiple threads - Nouveau didn't bother implementing it due to nobody needing it before now)
2015-12-05 01:04:13	koz_	It was over IRC.
2015-12-05 01:04:16	SylvieLorxu	Oh, okay
2015-12-05 01:04:19	koz_	I chatted to imirkin (a core Nouveau dev).
2015-12-05 01:04:41	koz_	They might actually consider doing this now.
2015-12-05 01:05:12	SylvieLorxu	Is that visible in glxinfo or should I tell that on the Warsow forum?
2015-12-05 01:05:22	koz_	They got it from the dump you posted.
2015-12-05 01:05:30	koz_	(I linked them to that forum post you linked me)
2015-12-05 01:06:24	koz_	Also, I can find out who you can speak to about your card instability problems.
2015-12-05 01:06:52	SylvieLorxu	Well, I'm not 100% sure if that's nouveau and I've never been able to get a log or anything
2015-12-05 01:07:01	turtleman_	SylvieLorxu dont worry much yet, the game hasnt really started yet
2015-12-05 01:07:18	turtleman_	if you have multiple posts, i suggest replying to yourself
2015-12-05 01:07:20	SylvieLorxu	It seems likely to be nouveau because it's a complete visual lockup and sound and stuff still works, but yeah
2015-12-05 01:07:21	turtleman_	then people can trace it
2015-12-05 01:07:30	SylvieLorxu	turtleman_: I replied to you
2015-12-05 01:07:33	turtleman_	ok
2015-12-05 01:07:38	turtleman_	thats fine then
2015-12-05 01:08:10	koz_	SylvieLorxu: At least they might suggest something you could do.
2015-12-05 01:08:17	koz_	If you don't want me to investigate, that's fine also.
2015-12-05 01:08:18	SylvieLorxu	Well, true
2015-12-05 01:08:27	SylvieLorxu	Oh, no, getting rid of these lock ups would be amazing
2015-12-05 01:08:40	koz_	SylvieLorxu: Well, in that case, permit me to investigate.
2015-12-05 01:09:02	turtleman_	i heard some people had success doing play-by-post on twitter
2015-12-05 01:09:11	turtleman_	so i figured i would give it a try with the character limit
2015-12-05 01:09:24	turtleman_	i think after character descriptions things can be much more brief

2015-12-05 22:27:48	Calinou	probably not
2015-12-05 22:28:02	Calinou	the reason is, those assets are there for ~10 years
2015-12-05 22:28:03	Calinou	it would break their brand image to replace them with (likely worse) assets
2015-12-05 22:28:16	koz_	Calinou: Would freeing them not be possible at all?
2015-12-05 22:28:26	koz_	Like, via relicensing or something.
2015-12-05 22:28:49	Calinou	the authors  died off or something

2015-12-06 11:35:05	fr33domlover	does it mean we have the new features now? :)
2015-12-06 11:38:55	TMM	not yet
2015-12-06 11:39:01	TMM	but I'm also moving serves

2015-12-06 16:32:18	Jookia	Okay back (had to load Pidgin with OTR plugin in)
2015-12-06 16:32:18	pizzaiolo	Jookia: novena?
2015-12-06 16:32:33	Jookia	Yep
2015-12-06 16:32:44	pizzaiolo	congrats friend
2015-12-06 16:32:46	pizzaiolo	you made it
2015-12-06 16:32:51	Jookia	Novena with Tor by default, openvpn in a container with a HTTP proxy leading out which i'm using for IRC
2015-12-06 16:33:09	pizzaiolo	do you pay for a vpn provider?
2015-12-06 16:33:23	Jookia	yeah- nordvpn in this case. using visa gift cards
2015-12-06 16:33:41	pizzaiolo	wow nice
2015-12-06 16:33:53	Jookia	my threat model is that vpns won't protect you from governments but will protect you against companies (copyright infringement, etc)
2015-12-06 16:33:58	kl3	Jookia: Why this extra HTTP proxy if you could just tunnel everything?
2015-12-06 16:34:15	Jookia	kl3: i don't want to tunnel everything over a VPN
2015-12-06 16:34:28	Jookia	kl3: i have a Tor proxy and a VPN proxy that i choose on a per-application basis
2015-12-06 16:34:39	pizzaiolo	LXC worked?
2015-12-06 16:34:49	Jookia	pizzaiolo: It worked but there's a bug that requires hacking around
2015-12-06 16:34:57	kl3	I see. What would you rather not send through a VPN and why??
2015-12-06 16:34:59	Jookia	qTox is also working pretty cool
2015-12-06 16:35:01	pizzaiolo	right
2015-12-06 16:35:45	Jookia	kl3: I'd ideally not send any traffic through a VPN since I have Tor as an alternative, so the question is 'which traffic WOULD you send through a VPN?', and it's IRC as it blocks Tor and bittorrent traffic
2015-12-06 16:36:03	Jookia	*everything* else is tor routed- even system updates
2015-12-06 16:36:32	Jookia	and it's done using an isolating firewall to avoid leaking data
2015-12-06 16:37:06	Jookia	anything not going through tor's HTTP proxy or SOCKS and doesn't fall in to other exceptions gets dropped, incoming or outgoing
2015-12-06 16:37:35	kl3	Jookia: Fair enough.
2015-12-06 16:37:52	kl3	Mind adding me on tox, btw? kl3@utox.org
2015-12-06 16:38:12	Jookia	kl3: Do you have a raw Tox ID? Tox DNS doesn't work over Tor/VPN
2015-12-06 16:39:24	zPluss	Jookia: you are doing so much work, that I think you should document it
2015-12-06 16:39:52	Jookia	zPluss: why, i am! all my system configuration is on nixos- so it's reproducible. i also am writing this in a private wiki explaining the design

2015-12-06 21:31:59	h0wl3vvd	zPluss: i see, i have some basic question, its more for logic than for a assembler, wait a second
2015-12-06 21:32:51	h0wl3vvd	https://bpaste.net/show/2cf73407eec9 < source of my memory managment function
2015-12-06 21:32:58	h0wl3vvd	i call them malloc and free
2015-12-06 21:33:33	h0wl3vvd	now i want to use them instead of default ones from glibc, im reading GNU book about assembler and i have that exam:
2015-12-06 21:33:46	h0wl3vvd	"Change the name of the functions to malloc and free, and build them into a
2015-12-06 21:33:47	h0wl3vvd	shared library. Use LD_PRELOAD to force them to be used as your memory
2015-12-06 21:33:47	h0wl3vvd	manager instead of the default one. Add some write system calls to STDOUT
2015-12-06 21:33:47	h0wl3vvd	to verify that your memory manager is being used instead of the default one."
2015-12-06 21:34:02	h0wl3vvd	im changed these names to malloc and free as exam says
2015-12-06 21:34:28	h0wl3vvd	now i have set up LD PRELOAD, by set LD_PRELOAD /path/library.so
2015-12-06 21:34:46	h0wl3vvd	but now programs going crash, especially gcc,as or ld
2015-12-06 21:35:08	h0wl3vvd	i want to debug my program when im using my library instead of default
2015-12-06 21:35:16	h0wl3vvd	but then when im type run in GDB im receiving segfault before first instruction...
2015-12-06 21:36:25	h0wl3vvd	i dont know how to properly solve that exam from this book, maybe im little lost, maybe someone can guide me abit, im trying to solve it already for hours...

2015-12-06 21:37:46	h0wl3vvd	its not that much about C
2015-12-06 21:37:58	h0wl3vvd	its more like just linux i think
2015-12-06 21:38:18	h0wl3vvd	but btw, i must ad
2015-12-06 21:38:22	h0wl3vvd	that my program working well when im link that library to it statically
2015-12-06 21:38:43	h0wl3vvd	but when im link it to glibc and then hanve preload to my library
2015-12-06 21:38:46	h0wl3vvd	then program crashed

2015-12-06 21:39:06	h0wl3vvd	i cant debug it where it crashed cuz debugger giving me segfault just after run

2015-12-06 21:39:09	zPluss	h0wl3vvd: have you tried $ LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/library.so ./myprogram
2015-12-06 21:39:10	koz_	I would recommend use of the Autotools to make this less annoying.
2015-12-06 21:39:14	koz_	Also that.
2015-12-06 21:39:53	h0wl3vvd	zPluss: yes
2015-12-06 21:39:54	h0wl3vvd	crashing
2015-12-06 21:42:07	zPluss	it should be loading your lib though. Perhaps your assembly is broken. Try to output something right at the beginning of your routine, you should see something

2015-12-06 21:43:10	h0wl3vvd	where ?
2015-12-06 21:44:31	zPluss	mmm I don't know, probably at first point in your code that's supposed to be executed
2015-12-06 21:44:56	h0wl3vvd	hm

2015-12-06 21:45:57	zPluss	h0wl3vvd: is your asm library actually loaded correctly?
2015-12-06 21:46:12	h0wl3vvd	where ?
2015-12-06 21:46:18	h0wl3vvd	into LD_PRELOAD
2015-12-06 21:46:19	h0wl3vvd	?
2015-12-06 21:47:12	turtleman_	is it just my imagination, or is slashdot full of climate change deniers
2015-12-06 21:47:50	zPluss	h0wl3vvd: which compiler are you using
2015-12-06 21:48:00	h0wl3vvd	as
2015-12-06 21:48:11	h0wl3vvd	i mean assembler

2015-12-06 22:01:22	Jookia	TMM: Me- but don't worry
2015-12-06 22:01:32	Jookia	TMM: https://bugzilla.netfilter.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041
2015-12-06 22:02:27	TMM	Jookia, I tested it, it doesn't appear to happen on fedora 23
2015-12-06 22:03:05	Jookia	TMM: Using those steps? What kernel/LXC version/nftables version?
2015-12-06 22:04:55	TMM	Jookia, well, I'm using iptables 
2015-12-06 22:05:01	TMM	and I'm not using lxc
2015-12-06 22:05:08	Jookia	TMM: Ah, well nftables is the problem here :P
2015-12-06 22:06:31	TMM	Jookia, I did all the steps lined out in that bugreport just now
2015-12-06 22:06:39	TMM	Jookia, my host does not lose network
2015-12-06 22:06:49	TMM	but again, I don't use lxc
2015-12-06 22:06:59	Jookia	TMM: It doesn't lost network with nftables?
2015-12-06 22:07:19	TMM	systemd-nspawn -D /var/lib/containers/fedora23/ -j -n -M test -b
2015-12-06 22:07:28	TMM	then did all the steps in that report
2015-12-06 22:07:31	TMM	nothing happened to the host
2015-12-06 22:07:43	Jookia	Hmm
2015-12-06 22:07:59	Jookia	What kernel? Do you have iptables running on the host?
2015-12-06 22:09:04	TMM	I didn't have any rules in iptables at the time
2015-12-06 22:09:38	TMM	this is my kernel, both the guest and host : Linux honor.tmm.cx 4.2.6-301.fc23.x86_64 #1 SMP Fri Nov 20 22:22:41 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2015-12-06 22:10:03	TMM	well, the guest is kind of irrelevant
2015-12-06 22:11:42	Jookia	no rules, meaning you had iptables flushed?
2015-12-06 22:12:01	Jookia	my best guess is that it's fixed in a newer kernel
2015-12-06 22:12:44	TMM	looks like it
2015-12-06 22:12:47	TMM	or it's lxc specific
2015-12-06 22:13:24	Jookia	It happens on nspawn on my Novena too
2015-12-06 22:13:36	TMM	maybe try booting a newer kernel

2015-12-07 00:33:05	zPlus	why
2015-12-07 00:35:04	pizzaiolo	it's so difficult to use
2015-12-07 00:35:21	pizzaiolo	I want to add a new line to a crontab and vim does everything except that
2015-12-07 00:35:29	pizzaiolo	how hard can it be to parse 'enter'
2015-12-07 00:37:09	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, some people say the same thing about computers in general :P
2015-12-07 00:37:21	fr33domlover	once you learn, suddenly it's easy
2015-12-07 00:37:32	fr33domlover	i assume the same works for emacs etc.
2015-12-07 00:37:41	fr33domlover	hard until you learn it
2015-12-07 00:40:56	pizzaiolo	y so hard
2015-12-07 00:41:07	pizzaiolo	y cant u be like nano <3
2015-12-07 00:41:09	pizzaiolo	simple
2015-12-07 00:41:24	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, because then you can just use nano
2015-12-07 00:41:32	fr33domlover	vim isn't a nano clone :P
2015-12-07 00:41:38	pizzaiolo	can I use it for cron though?
2015-12-07 00:41:42	fr33domlover	sure
2015-12-07 00:41:46	pizzaiolo	wow
2015-12-07 00:41:48	pizzaiolo	how?
2015-12-07 00:42:12	fr33domlover	pick nano as your default editor, i think, or see if you can tell `crontab -e` which editor you want
2015-12-07 00:42:28	pizzaiolo	fr33domlover: how do I change the default?
2015-12-07 00:43:15	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, there are so many ways... maybe just `export EDITOR=nano` is enough, maybe you'll need to editor debian's alternatives stuff ...
2015-12-07 00:43:19	fr33domlover	i don't remember
2015-12-07 00:43:29	fr33domlover	try `echo $EDITOR` first
2015-12-07 00:43:32	pizzaiolo	I'm on parabola

2015-12-07 00:44:13	pizzaiolo	an empty line
2015-12-07 00:45:02	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, try `export EDITOR=nano` and then the crontab command
2015-12-07 00:45:07	pizzaiolo	ok
2015-12-07 00:45:12	fr33domlover	the manpage says it uses the EDITOR env variable :P
2015-12-07 00:45:39	pizzaiolo	fr33domlover: it works! thank you
2015-12-07 00:45:51	fr33domlover	glad to help, pizzaiolo 
2015-12-07 00:46:07	pizzaiolo	does the crontab file name matter?
2015-12-07 00:46:28	pizzaiolo	does it need to be a specific file name for it to run normally?
2015-12-07 00:46:50	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, i edit crontabs using `crontab -e` so i don't pick names. or do you mean the system-global files?
2015-12-07 00:46:58	fr33domlover	i think names don't matter at all there
2015-12-07 00:47:06	fr33domlover	it just reads all the files in cron.d/
2015-12-07 00:47:17	fr33domlover	or whatever the directory is
2015-12-07 00:47:17	pizzaiolo	it's just that nano asks if I want to save it under the same name
2015-12-07 00:47:24	fr33domlover	then yes
2015-12-07 00:47:26	fr33domlover	same name

2015-12-07 00:57:56	fr33domlover	which is GNU's init system
2015-12-07 00:58:06	pizzaiolo	huh
2015-12-07 00:58:18	pizzaiolo	is it a bad init system? I never heard about it
2015-12-07 00:58:40	fr33domlover	i don't know, but systemd is such a disaster to the free software community...
2015-12-07 00:58:47	fr33domlover	almost anything else is better
2015-12-07 00:59:36	pizzaiolo	I'm indifferent to systemd itself, but I'm wary that everyone is using it
2015-12-07 00:59:40	pizzaiolo	diversity is good
2015-12-07 01:00:10	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, exactly - make systemd /optional/ at most, never a hard dependency
2015-12-07 01:00:24	fr33domlover	but systemd is a monster
2015-12-07 01:00:39	fr33domlover	it's made to be a dependency, to get tied hard to everything :/
2015-12-07 01:00:50	pizzaiolo	GNU dmd is a "Daemon managing Daemons" (or "Daemons-managing Daemon"?), i.e. a service manager that provides a replacement for the service-managing capabilities of SysV-init (or any other init) with a both powerful and beautiful dependency-based system with a convenient interface. It is intended for use on GNU/Hurd, but it is supposed to work on every POSIX-like system where Guile is available.  In particular, it has been tested on GNU/Linux,
2015-12-07 01:00:52	pizzaiolo	interesting
2015-12-07 01:00:52	fr33domlover	thank you redhat devs working on so many free software projecrs
2015-12-07 01:01:29	fr33domlover	awesome, a functional init system

2015-12-07 01:02:36	francis7	it won't be complete until libreboot is universally compatible with every computer on earth
2015-12-07 01:02:44	francis7	every computer in use, rather
2015-12-07 01:03:02	pizzaiolo	maybe that's a different definition of completeness :P
2015-12-07 01:03:09	fr33domlover	also Hurd doesn't seem very popular, not sure really how complete it is...
2015-12-07 01:03:18	francis7	linux-libre is a GNU package
2015-12-07 01:03:20	pizzaiolo	fr33domlover: linux-libre is gnu

2015-12-07 01:03:35	pizzaiolo	heh
2015-12-07 01:03:59	fr33domlover	so GNU == GNU/Linux-libre ?
2015-12-07 01:04:11	pizzaiolo	not necessarily
2015-12-07 01:04:20	pizzaiolo	GNU can be GNU/Hurd
2015-12-07 01:05:07	pizzaiolo	I find it weird that GNU incorporates web projects like mediagoblin
2015-12-07 01:05:17	pizzaiolo	it's not really an operating system component
2015-12-07 01:06:37	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, I think GNU just wants "at least one project to fill each need"
2015-12-07 01:06:52	fr33domlover	so mediagoblin would be GNU's answer to "federated media hosting" etc.
2015-12-07 01:06:55	pizzaiolo	right

2015-12-07 01:25:33	koz_	pizzaiolo: Stick it in your .bashrc?
2015-12-07 01:28:21	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, find out how to pick a default editor in parabola
2015-12-07 01:28:55	fr33domlover	unless $EDITOR is the way in parabola :P
2015-12-07 01:29:59	pizzaiolo	according to duckduckgo, koz_ is right
2015-12-07 01:30:37	fr33domlover	btw koz_, i read your post about swift
2015-12-07 01:30:45	koz_	fr33domlover: Oh?
2015-12-07 01:30:54	fr33domlover	koz_, in the blog
2015-12-07 01:31:33	koz_	I know - I put that 'Oh?' as in 'Oh really? Cool!' kinda thing.
2015-12-07 01:32:06	fr33domlover	all good points, but there is one you didn't address: what is swift is a collection of non-innovative features, but is a unique collection of such features. i believe it isn't, but perhaos you should state that too :P
2015-12-07 01:32:16	fr33domlover	*what if
2015-12-07 01:33:15	fr33domlover	probably just crapple's ego won't let it use c# or go or some other lang made by competitors
2015-12-07 01:33:56	pizzaiolo	whatever free software comes from swift, I'll be happy :)
2015-12-07 01:34:15	pizzaiolo	unless it's a surveillance tool or something
2015-12-07 01:34:29	fr33domlover	this is something i like about haskell: while i saw c++ mainly getting features from other languages (such as lambdas), haskell gets new stuff fresh from new research
2015-12-07 01:34:36	fr33domlover	like, real innovation before your eyes

2015-12-07 01:35:45	koz_	It's not a unique collection of those features - at least three languages I can name right now have that same feature set.
2015-12-07 01:36:04	fr33domlover	koz_, indeed - just saying it's worth pointing out
2015-12-07 01:36:26	fr33domlover	it's not just a collection of existing features, but also a boring collection of them :P
2015-12-07 01:36:35	koz_	Lol.
2015-12-07 01:36:37	koz_	Good point.
2015-12-07 01:36:44	fr33domlover	unless you are a crapple ithing dev limited to the crappy objective c
2015-12-07 01:36:51	koz_	Yeah.
2015-12-07 01:37:03	fr33domlover	in which case swift is like, you get a daily walk in the prison
2015-12-07 01:37:07	fr33domlover	corridor
2015-12-07 01:37:12	koz_	Lol, exactly!
2015-12-07 01:39:39	pizzaiolo	dumb question time: is GuixSD a binary or source-based distro?
2015-12-07 01:43:21	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, iirc it supports both, intentionally
2015-12-07 01:43:35	pizzaiolo	interesting
2015-12-07 01:43:43	fr33domlover	source based makes it easier to participate in development and make a free software community
2015-12-07 01:43:49	pizzaiolo	I want to try it sometime
2015-12-07 01:43:53	fr33domlover	and binary packages are great for regular use
2015-12-07 01:44:23	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, me too :P
2015-12-07 01:44:56	pizzaiolo	fr33domlover: it sounds like they're making great strides
2015-12-07 01:45:13	fr33domlover	but to be honest, more than that i want to get rid of my dependency of computers :-P so many issues with them...
2015-12-07 01:45:23	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, they've been here for years
2015-12-07 01:45:48	pizzaiolo	but... but... computers are so good
2015-12-07 01:45:48	fr33domlover	but i suppose recently things got serious
2015-12-07 01:46:14	fr33domlover	pizzaiolo, they do good things but right now they do a huge load of horrible things too
2015-12-07 01:46:35	pizzaiolo	true
2015-12-07 01:47:11	koz_	pizzaiolo: Was it you who forked awesome-gamedev?
2015-12-07 01:47:22	pizzaiolo	koz_: t'was not
2015-12-07 01:47:48	pizzaiolo	maybe a secret admirer of yours
2015-12-07 01:50:05	koz_	Maybe... I wonder whether they'll make a PR.

2015-12-07 20:01:35	SylvieLorxu_	That doesn't sound good

2015-12-07 20:21:23	Calinou	lrn2git
2015-12-07 20:21:50	Jookia	More headaches for me
2015-12-07 20:21:54	Jookia	Calinou: huh?
2015-12-07 20:21:58	Calinou	learn to git
2015-12-07 20:22:14	Jookia	I know git
2015-12-07 20:22:42	francis7	Jookia, use git
2015-12-07 20:22:55	Jookia	francis7: i'm not the one developing, i'm just checking out a repo
2015-12-07 20:22:58	francis7	git also has problems
2015-12-07 20:23:07	francis7	but it's the best popular scm that we have
2015-12-07 20:23:29	francis7	To me, those problems are:
2015-12-07 20:23:46	francis7	* submodules feature is broken by nature, it barely works
2015-12-07 20:24:02	francis7	* retroactive changing of name/email on older commits is not possible without changing commit IDs
2015-12-07 20:24:57	francis7	* not very efficient for binaries (that figures, I guess). Things like images and so on in a git repository can quickly become a bad idea
2015-12-07 20:25:26	Calinou	often you can't avoid it
2015-12-07 20:26:00	Jookia	I wish someone would take the theory of Darcs, the local feature of Fossil and make a next-generation DVCS
2015-12-07 20:26:51	Jookia	Git hasn't really improved since its inception
2015-12-07 20:27:12	Jookia	It's the modern day SVN
2015-12-07 20:27:53	francis7	Jookia, do you have vast experience in C/C++ and several years of programming experience?
2015-12-07 20:28:07	Jookia	francis7: Not vast, no- why
2015-12-07 20:28:15	francis7	substantial enough, then
2015-12-07 20:28:22	francis7	Jookia, why don't you start on said project?
2015-12-07 20:28:28	Jookia	I have other projects
2015-12-07 20:28:40	Jookia	I might eventually, but I really have tons
2015-12-07 20:28:47	Jookia	More pressing ones to do
2015-12-07 20:28:48	francis7	git is widely used
2015-12-07 20:28:55	francis7	a lot of sites integrate for it exclusively
2015-12-07 20:29:03	Jookia	So?
2015-12-07 20:29:05	francis7	it's the go-to scm for some time in the future at least
2015-12-07 20:29:14	Jookia	Well yeah
2015-12-07 20:29:19	francis7	a new, better scm will take a while to gain traction
2015-12-07 20:29:26	francis7	because of the "good enough" rule
2015-12-07 20:29:32	Jookia	Yep
2015-12-07 20:29:51	francis7	just fix those 3 things I mentioned, and I'm happy
2015-12-07 20:29:56	Jookia	Doesn't bother me if I make unpopular tools
2015-12-07 20:29:59	francis7	git is really nice, except for those things
2015-12-07 20:30:23	Jookia	I'm not saying replace git, I'm saying we make something better

2015-12-07 20:31:11	Jookia	You use a different file manager to me most likely
2015-12-07 20:31:11	francis7	ok
2015-12-07 20:31:22	francis7	I think an scm has to be widely used and understood to be useful
2015-12-07 20:31:33	francis7	someone can easily contribute to libreboot, because they know how to use git, which it uses
2015-12-07 20:31:34	Jookia	Why widely used?
2015-12-07 20:31:44	SylvieLorxu	The binary thing is "fixed by a hack" with git-LFS
2015-12-07 20:31:54	SylvieLorxu	Which is basically "we store the file on another server and use a pointer"
2015-12-07 20:31:55	francis7	if not widely used and understood, then it must be easy to learn
2015-12-07 20:31:57	Jookia	Sylvie: Is that that garbage github thing?
2015-12-07 20:32:06	SylvieLorxu	Yes, but it's not GitHub-exclusive anymore
2015-12-07 20:32:16	Jookia	It's a NIH github thing
2015-12-07 20:32:20	SylvieLorxu	GitLab implemented it too, in both the community and proprietary edition
2015-12-07 20:32:33	Jookia	There's way better ways to handle large files in Git
2015-12-07 20:32:44	SylvieLorxu	Like?
2015-12-07 20:32:46	Jookia	git annex
2015-12-07 20:33:00	SylvieLorxu	Hmm
2015-12-07 20:33:09	SylvieLorxu	I guess I should read up on that once
2015-12-07 20:33:15	Jookia	Which is years old and I use on a daily basis
2015-12-07 20:33:22	Jookia	And decentralized
2015-12-07 20:33:52	SylvieLorxu	Hmm, git annex does encryption...
2015-12-07 20:33:55	Jookia	github once again makes garbage
2015-12-07 20:34:19	francis7	and on that note, you're dealing with unfair competition
2015-12-07 20:34:20	SylvieLorxu	Maybe something for a TODO app
2015-12-07 20:34:26	Jookia	francis7: hmm?
2015-12-07 20:34:33	francis7	git became popular quickly, just because linus torvards wrote it
2015-12-07 20:34:34	SylvieLorxu	I want a nice TODO app that syncs between devices and is end-to-end encrypted
2015-12-07 20:34:38	SylvieLorxu	But I can't find anything
2015-12-07 20:34:54	francis7	and linux was using it
2015-12-07 20:34:55	Jookia	francis7: yeah, but git's not meant for actual user friendliness
2015-12-07 20:35:07	Jookia	francis7: it's meant for sending patches over email
2015-12-07 20:35:20	francis7	Jookia, which is pretty much every project
2015-12-07 20:35:37	Jookia	every project sends patches over email?
2015-12-07 20:35:49	francis7	and it's not a problem. you have stuff like notabug sitting on top of git and doing things like pull requests etc
2015-12-07 20:35:56	francis7	and you have review interfaces like gerrit
2015-12-07 20:35:56	francis7	etc
2015-12-07 20:36:08	francis7	Jookia, this is how libreboot does code review:
2015-12-07 20:36:17	francis7	http://libreboot.org/git/#sendpatch
2015-12-07 20:36:18	fpbot	“Git repositories”
2015-12-07 20:36:35	francis7	Most of the patches I get come from mailing lists, or even paste sites
2015-12-07 20:36:42	francis7	sometimes they'll link a repo and I cherry pick that
2015-12-07 20:36:51	Jookia	You're in the minority of projects that use Git properly
2015-12-07 20:37:11	francis7	email and IRC
2015-12-07 20:37:15	francis7	what more could you want?
2015-12-07 20:37:17	Jookia	the reason why notabug/github are problems is because they're centralized
2015-12-07 20:37:28	francis7	yeah
2015-12-07 20:37:34	francis7	I don't rely on notabug at all
2015-12-07 20:37:34	SylvieLorxu	Federated pull requests would be cool
2015-12-07 20:37:39	francis7	it's just a backup solution for me
2015-12-07 20:37:42	francis7	one of many backup solutions
2015-12-07 20:37:44	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: federation is just as bad
2015-12-07 20:37:52	francis7	notabug could die right now and I wouldn't care. There are backups
2015-12-07 20:37:56	SylvieLorxu	It's definitely not "just as bad"
2015-12-07 20:38:08	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: what goal does it achieve?
2015-12-07 20:38:10	francis7	git is federated nicely like that
2015-12-07 20:38:19	SylvieLorxu	It may not be good enough for your taste but it's still an improvement
2015-12-07 20:38:24	SylvieLorxu	And a very easy to support one
2015-12-07 20:38:24	Jookia	francis7: git is federated, notabug/github aren't
2015-12-07 20:38:38	francis7	Jookia, there will always be centralization
2015-12-07 20:38:41	Jookia	francis7: People who use the issue tracker in notabug/github or pull requests will lose history when those projects die
2015-12-07 20:38:45	francis7	people find ways to centralize things
2015-12-07 20:38:54	Jookia	Issues, wikis, pull requests should be part of the repository itself
2015-12-07 20:39:07	francis7	because they don't care about being in control, they just want to get <thing> done quickly
2015-12-07 20:40:00	Jookia	Source code history is decentralized, but contribution isn't
2015-12-07 20:40:05	Jookia	:(
2015-12-07 20:40:24	francis7	centralization isn't actually a bad thing
2015-12-07 20:40:31	Jookia	Oh?
2015-12-07 20:40:32	francis7	as long as people are able to switch away from it at a moments notice
2015-12-07 20:40:35	francis7	and take over
2015-12-07 20:40:40	francis7	with a competitor
2015-12-07 20:40:56	francis7	software projects are an example of centralization
2015-12-07 20:41:05	francis7	management of most projects tends to be done centrally
2015-12-07 20:41:06	Jookia	Political or technical centralization?
2015-12-07 20:41:11	francis7	political
2015-12-07 20:41:18	Jookia	I'm talking technical here
2015-12-07 20:41:22	francis7	ok
2015-12-07 20:41:29	francis7	technical should always be decentral
2015-12-07 20:42:33	Jookia	You updated the libreboot site
2015-12-07 20:42:42	francis7	yes?
2015-12-07 20:43:02	francis7	I made it better
2015-12-07 20:43:13	Jookia	It looks nice
2015-12-07 20:44:03	francis7	http://libreboot.org/common/css/main.css <-- that's the css for that page
2015-12-07 20:44:05	francis7	it's tiny
2015-12-07 20:45:03	Jookia	Nice
2015-12-07 20:45:03	francis7	it's really bad hacky css. most web devs look at that and cry
2015-12-07 20:45:15	francis7	it abuses all kinds of tricks
2015-12-07 20:45:38	francis7	readability isn't the priority. reducing the size of the page is
2015-12-07 20:46:03	SylvieLorxu	It's also horribly incorrect
2015-12-07 20:46:18	francis7	:)
2015-12-07 20:46:21	SylvieLorxu	The libreboot page's height is twice that of the content
2015-12-07 20:46:33	francis7	that's intentional
2015-12-07 20:46:34	SylvieLorxu	And no, reducing the size of the page should not be the priority
2015-12-07 20:46:41	francis7	so that you can scroll to see the background image
2015-12-07 20:46:47	SylvieLorxu	Especially not in the Free Software world
2015-12-07 20:47:00	SylvieLorxu	What use does it have to share the code if it's deliberately made unmaintainable?
2015-12-07 20:47:07	SylvieLorxu	Okay, then that's just a horrible design choice
2015-12-07 20:47:10	francis7	SylvieLorxu, the site is in a git repository
2015-12-07 20:47:17	francis7	https://notabug.org/fchmmr/libreboot-website/commits/master
2015-12-07 20:47:20	SylvieLorxu	Yes, but nobody can do anything with it
2015-12-07 20:47:21	fpbot	“fchmmr/libreboot-website - NotABug.org: Free code hosting”
2015-12-07 20:47:23	francis7	the non-minified pages are there
2015-12-07 20:47:29	SylvieLorxu	Because you've purposely made the CSS unmaintainable
2015-12-07 20:47:38	francis7	and you can use utils that automatically reformat the minified html
2015-12-07 20:47:40	SylvieLorxu	Not for the intent of harming collaboration
2015-12-07 20:47:49	SylvieLorxu	But that is still very much what's happening here
2015-12-07 20:47:53	francis7	it was mainly done for fun
2015-12-07 20:47:58	francis7	just to see how small I could get it
2015-12-07 20:48:06	SylvieLorxu	...Your CSS is also inline
2015-12-07 20:48:07	SylvieLorxu	Why.
2015-12-07 20:48:09	francis7	I can reduce it by another 3 bytes, but it makes things look a bit unbalanced
2015-12-07 20:48:14	SylvieLorxu	That actively makes your site slower
2015-12-07 20:48:18	francis7	SylvieLorxu, to reduce the number of HTTP requests
2015-12-07 20:48:21	SylvieLorxu	Because inline CSS prevents caching
2015-12-07 20:48:36	francis7	for most people, latency is the issue, not speed
2015-12-07 20:48:40	Jookia	^
2015-12-07 20:48:46	SylvieLorxu	Yes, so you save 1 HTTP request on an already open connection, but instead download the whole content of the file again and again and again on every single page
2015-12-07 20:48:59	Jookia	Tor users get shafted on sites with tons of images/CSS
2015-12-07 20:49:13	SylvieLorxu	I have yet to see that happen
2015-12-07 20:49:23	francis7	I actually have Tor and dialup users in mind
2015-12-07 20:49:33	francis7	I've shafted dialup users by adding that backgroaund image, though
2015-12-07 20:49:46	SylvieLorxu	Still, these choices made little sense
2015-12-07 20:49:55	SylvieLorxu	You make every page bigger by adding the CSS inline
2015-12-07 20:49:59	Jookia	francis7: Thanks for including us :)
2015-12-07 20:50:08	SylvieLorxu	Yet, the Libreboot logo, which you only use on a single page it seems, is a second image
2015-12-07 20:50:17	SylvieLorxu	And not inline base64-encoded
2015-12-07 20:50:32	francis7	SylvieLorxu, you can fix these issues :)
2015-12-07 20:50:52	francis7	site is in git: http://libreboot.org/git/#download
2015-12-07 20:50:53	SylvieLorxu	I'm sorry, but I'm not going to, because I disagree with your design style generally
2015-12-07 20:50:58	zPlus_	honestly francis7, I've always wondered why so waste so much time optimizing your website css (except for the fun of it)
2015-12-07 20:51:16	francis7	zPlus_, mainly just the fun of it
2015-12-07 20:51:24	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: Design style?
2015-12-07 20:51:24	SylvieLorxu	I'm not saying my site is perfect. Hell, my site needs to get way optimized, but yeah
2015-12-07 20:51:28	francis7	SylvieLorxu is a web developer
2015-12-07 20:51:31	SylvieLorxu	Jookia: Development choices, whatever
2015-12-07 20:51:34	francis7	she does this for a living, professionally
2015-12-07 20:51:45	Jookia	I'm kind of a web developer too
2015-12-07 20:51:54	francis7	I don't do web dev professionally, libreboot.org is just a lazily written site that works somewhat well
2015-12-07 20:51:57	Jookia	I don't think it's that big a deal
2015-12-07 20:52:00	SylvieLorxu	Combining presentation and content in one file, harming maintainability for negligable speed increases, stuff like that
2015-12-07 20:52:11	Jookia	Harming maintainability for fun
2015-12-07 20:52:17	francis7	SylvieLorxu, that css is pretty hackable I think
2015-12-07 20:52:22	francis7	so is the whole site
2015-12-07 20:52:31	SylvieLorxu	I'm sorry, but it's the worst CSS I have ever seen
2015-12-07 20:52:31	francis7	it's only minified when you view the site
2015-12-07 20:52:35	francis7	:)
2015-12-07 20:52:37	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: the worst CSS?
2015-12-07 20:52:40	SylvieLorxu	And if someone would give this to me as a project
2015-12-07 20:52:43	Jookia	It looks okay to me
2015-12-07 20:52:44	francis7	SylvieLorxu, that was my intention
2015-12-07 20:52:47	SylvieLorxu	I'd not even bother with it and rewrite it from scratch
2015-12-07 20:52:53	SylvieLorxu	That CSS is absolutely unmaintainable
2015-12-07 20:53:04	francis7	SylvieLorxu, it was literally written to be the smallest, most optimized, most bad css ever
2015-12-07 20:53:17	SylvieLorxu	And each entry has responsibility for several, completely different, utterly unrelated parts of the site
2015-12-07 20:53:32	SylvieLorxu	Tweaking one small thing shouldn't break everything else
2015-12-07 20:53:47	Jookia	I don't think francis is disagreeing with you
2015-12-07 20:54:05	francis7	yeah I agree with everything SylvieLorxu's saying
2015-12-07 20:54:15	SylvieLorxu	He still calls the site hackable, but that CSS just isn't, lol
2015-12-07 20:54:24	francis7	but libreboot.org is just my little thing that I toy with for fun
2015-12-07 20:54:27	SylvieLorxu	On that note, I should get to optimizing my site again, it's WAY too heavy
2015-12-07 20:54:35	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: link?
2015-12-07 20:54:36	francis7	libreboot.org is so bad that it could fall apart
2015-12-07 20:54:43	francis7	so you hold it together
2015-12-07 20:54:44	francis7	etc
2015-12-07 20:55:10	Jookia	I wish I could have a CSS for my wiki that looks like Libreboot's
2015-12-07 20:55:19	SylvieLorxu	At very least my site should work without JS just fine
2015-12-07 20:55:25	SylvieLorxu	Although I should test that again

2015-12-07 20:57:10	kl3	SylvieLorxu: Mind linking your website here?
2015-12-07 20:57:15	francis7	SylvieLorxu, your site lags on slow computers
2015-12-07 20:57:20	francis7	that's a problem

2015-12-07 20:57:40	Jookia	It doesn't work too well without acceleration
2015-12-07 20:57:40	francis7	SylvieMobile, the old version with a background image, it was smoother
2015-12-07 20:57:43	SylvieMobile	kl3: I do mind, actually
2015-12-07 20:57:49	francis7	lagging page = customer is put off
2015-12-07 20:58:01	Jookia	SylvieMobile: why?
2015-12-07 20:58:08	francis7	I actually liked the old background image that you had
2015-12-07 20:58:18	SylvieMobile	Because it links two identities that I don't want to link
2015-12-07 20:58:21	francis7	the one with the hand touching that screen, with the purple fingernails
2015-12-07 20:58:24	francis7	it looked pretty
2015-12-07 20:58:32	SylvieMobile	Honestly, Francis, people bitch no matter what
2015-12-07 20:58:42	Jookia	'bitch'?
2015-12-07 20:59:00	francis7	the new contracode site does look nice though
2015-12-07 20:59:03	SylvieMobile	Generally, people like this new background more and hated the images because they were "distracting"
2015-12-07 20:59:18	▬▬▶	SylvieLorxu (~TheLastPr@dhcp-077-251-165-191.chello.nl) has joined #freepost
2015-12-07 20:59:22	SylvieMobile	Welp, okay, now the identities are linked here anyway. Whatever I guess
2015-12-07 20:59:51	Jookia	SylvieMobile: this isn't about liking, just more how laggy it is
2015-12-07 21:00:34	SylvieMobile	I know, I'm still trying to figure out how to at least make that canvas less wasteful
2015-12-07 21:00:41	SylvieMobile	And I think I have an idea now actually
2015-12-07 21:00:43	Jookia	Don't use canvas
2015-12-07 21:01:21	SylvieLorxu	Canvas is the sanest way to do this
2015-12-07 21:01:36	Jookia	You can't run a webm in the background?
2015-12-07 21:03:29	SylvieLorxu	That's a million times more bandwidth-intensive
2015-12-07 21:03:52	Jookia	Ah, bandwidth over usability?
2015-12-07 21:04:13	SylvieLorxu	...
2015-12-07 21:04:17	Jookia	:P
2015-12-07 21:04:43	Jookia	You might want to have it automatically disable if it lags then?
2015-12-07 21:04:43	SylvieLorxu	You were literally just complaining that the main issue is bandwidth and now you're telling me to add additional files and waste huge amounts of bandwidth
2015-12-07 21:04:56	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: The main issue is latency, not bandwidth
2015-12-07 21:05:07	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: responsiveness
2015-12-07 21:05:14	SylvieLorxu	If I knew how to even notice that, sure, but for now I found a quick fix that makes things a million times better already
2015-12-07 21:05:16	francis7	I might use link rel for css actually
2015-12-07 21:05:20	francis7	instead of inlining it
2015-12-07 21:05:22	SylvieLorxu	On everything except IE8 but screw IE8
2015-12-07 21:05:44	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: Install Tor Browser and run it without graphical acceleration in a nested X session
2015-12-07 21:06:17	SylvieLorxu	I don't even know how to do that last thing
2015-12-07 21:06:22	Jookia	Xpra
2015-12-07 21:06:52	Jookia	Basically, Tor Browser slows JS and it's looking at software rendering eventually
2015-12-07 21:07:09	zPlus_	why do you guys seems to be wanting to optimize everything! Do you also optimize every drop of water that exits from your tap?
2015-12-07 21:07:25	Jookia	zPlus_: generally you optimize things that freeze up pages
2015-12-07 21:08:35	SylvieLorxu	I figured out a way to make the background a lot less laggy
2015-12-07 21:08:36	francis7	SylvieLorxu, libreboot.org used to have no css at all
2015-12-07 21:08:46	SylvieLorxu	Because apparently browsers are stupid and like to draw things that aren't visible on the screen as well
2015-12-07 21:08:48	francis7	it was always an annoyance to add it, so I wanted it to be as small as possible
2015-12-07 21:08:59	francis7	the site is very minimal layout wise
2015-12-07 21:09:01	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: Nice
2015-12-07 21:09:05	SylvieLorxu	I'll fix this up and push it soon. It's not going to be OMFGAMAZING but still a huge improvement
2015-12-07 21:09:13	SylvieLorxu	By not rendering outside of the freakin' screen lol
2015-12-07 21:09:17	francis7	all the css does really is just float some images and display:inline some unordered lists
2015-12-07 21:09:23	francis7	the rest is mainly colouring
2015-12-07 21:09:26	francis7	and fonts
2015-12-07 21:09:26	francis7	etc
2015-12-07 21:09:38	francis7	every page is basically just an open document
2015-12-07 21:09:48	francis7	not "content" but "information"
2015-12-07 21:10:22	Jookia	I wish I was a good developer like Sylvie
2015-12-07 21:10:28	francis7	I could get a nice little boilerplate pack if I wanted
2015-12-07 21:10:31	francis7	bootstrap for instance
2015-12-07 21:10:42	francis7	in fact, it originally did use that on the site
2015-12-07 21:10:46	tane	arg, keep it simple
2015-12-07 21:10:49	Jookia	Web development is really hard
2015-12-07 21:11:05	Jookia	I applaud Sylvie for getting a site like that working
2015-12-07 21:11:05	francis7	I threw that into the black hole and just did a plain site without css
2015-12-07 21:11:12	tane	I have rather huge DNS problems, so any site that relies on cacheble externals does not render here at times, which makes me not want to visit them :)
2015-12-07 21:11:17	francis7	then got "pressured" into adding some minimal css
2015-12-07 21:11:24	francis7	which led to the css that the site now uses
2015-12-07 21:11:31	Jookia	francis7: pressured? by the CSS police?
2015-12-07 21:11:39	francis7	yeah, those people
2015-12-07 21:11:42	Jookia	Fucking subversion
2015-12-07 21:11:53	Jookia	Why can't you just use a proxy like a normal system
2015-12-07 21:12:42	francis7	the web is pretty dumb to be honest
2015-12-07 21:12:47	francis7	these days
2015-12-07 21:12:48	SylvieLorxu	Websites suck
2015-12-07 21:12:53	francis7	seriously
2015-12-07 21:12:54	Jookia	How am I going to fix this shit
2015-12-07 21:12:57	francis7	I just want information
2015-12-07 21:12:59	SylvieLorxu	And I guess I'm sorry for being so... careless about bandwidth and so
2015-12-07 21:13:06	SylvieLorxu	But people pay me to make pretty things
2015-12-07 21:13:12	francis7	I have to scroll through javascript animations and big images
2015-12-07 21:13:13	francis7	and ads
2015-12-07 21:13:17	francis7	oh god, the ads
2015-12-07 21:13:19	SylvieLorxu	So I need to attract people's attention with pretty things
2015-12-07 21:13:24	SylvieLorxu	Instead of actually sane things
2015-12-07 21:13:24	francis7	just give me some good, old fashioned information
2015-12-07 21:13:33	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: And I'm sorry for being a complete fucking asshole and only having criticisms for you instead of nice things to say
2015-12-07 21:13:38	francis7	I don't even use the web to buy things most of the time
2015-12-07 21:13:43	francis7	I order stuff from suppliers via email
2015-12-07 21:13:44	SylvieLorxu	Nah, your criticism is completely valid
2015-12-07 21:13:53	SylvieLorxu	And it pushed me to getting rid of this one stupid bug
2015-12-07 21:13:53	francis7	or over the phone
2015-12-07 21:13:56	francis7	they send invoice
2015-12-07 21:13:59	SylvieLorxu	That wastes resources like mad
2015-12-07 21:14:01	francis7	I initiate transfer
2015-12-07 21:14:06	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: Even if it's valid it doesn't make me a good friend- I'm not great
2015-12-07 21:14:07	francis7	they send receipt, plus goods
2015-12-07 21:14:15	Jookia	francis7: fax it?
2015-12-07 21:14:24	francis7	and most info I need is in info/man pages
2015-12-07 21:14:27	francis7	or people on mailing lists
2015-12-07 21:14:45	francis7	come to think of it, I use the web not that often for actual information, rather just entertainment
2015-12-07 21:14:46	francis7	...
2015-12-07 21:15:24	Jookia	francis7: I only use the web for reading/research/some video series
2015-12-07 21:15:39	Jookia	francis7: It's great having time
2015-12-07 21:15:59	SylvieLorxu	I sometimes need a kick in the right direction
2015-12-07 21:16:05	francis7	SylvieLorxu, Jookia http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/

2015-12-07 21:58:38	SylvieLorxu	No, I said "Either it didn't log to this file or it's not nouveau"
2015-12-07 21:58:42	SylvieLorxu	To which I never got a reaction
2015-12-07 21:58:56	SylvieLorxu	nouveau is still what all my crashes have in common
2015-12-07 21:59:09	SylvieLorxu	It's definitely not Plasma 5, because I had it in KDE 4 and GNOME3 days as well
2015-12-07 21:59:17	koz_	Hmmm.
2015-12-07 21:59:19	SylvieLorxu	Well, I guess they also all have Xorg in common

2015-12-07 22:02:15	koz_	Here's a nicer one: http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/12/tone-policing-and-privilege/
2015-12-07 22:03:51	koz_	Like, everything there is so amazingly relevant to free software and the kind of shit we get for it, I'm amazed.
2015-12-07 22:03:54	koz_	I may even blog about it!
2015-12-07 22:05:07	tane	don't say that to the wrong folks
2015-12-07 22:06:18	SylvieLorxu	koz_: Agree and disagree
2015-12-07 22:06:31	koz_	SylvieLorxu: Best position ever! Why do you disagree?
2015-12-07 22:06:32	tane	koz_, could you elaborate a bit more on what you mean by relevant?
2015-12-07 22:06:50	SylvieLorxu	I agree that emotion is definitely an important part of a lot of discussion and a fair bit of things I feel cannot be discussed without emotion
2015-12-07 22:07:07	koz_	tane: We get tone policed all the time, both by open-source shills and people who like proprietary software.
2015-12-07 22:07:27	SylvieLorxu	However, there is still the necessity on not just yelling constantly, because at that point you end up at a place where you may very well be attacking people who mean well but made an honest mistake
2015-12-07 22:07:28	koz_	And some of those tone policing + other thing combinations translate to *actual things I have heard* such people say or type.
2015-12-07 22:07:37	tane	yes, like myself calling you out on your harsh apple criticism :)
2015-12-07 22:07:46	SylvieLorxu	And not watching tone makes it very easy for conversations to derail to ad hominem attacks
2015-12-07 22:07:53	koz_	SylvieLorxu: Your point is well-made.
2015-12-07 22:07:55	SylvieLorxu	So, perhaps we need less tone policing
2015-12-07 22:07:59	SylvieLorxu	But we still need a bit
2015-12-07 22:08:29	koz_	Well, I'm still of the opinion that tone policing is used against free software people all the time.
2015-12-07 22:08:30	koz_	Myself included.
2015-12-07 22:08:39	SylvieLorxu	I get the point of the topic, though, and largely agree it's a good point
2015-12-07 22:08:48	SylvieLorxu	But, as always, we need to watch out to not see things black and white
2015-12-07 22:08:51	koz_	I identify with this so strongly precisely because of this - this finally gives a *name* to what I see happen all the time.
2015-12-07 22:09:34	SylvieLorxu	This reminds me of the way people try to silence me when I talk about animal rights, though
2015-12-07 22:09:43	SylvieLorxu	Like "Oh, you're letting your emotions run you"
2015-12-07 22:10:04	SylvieLorxu	Of fucking course I am, because clearly your sense of ethics is utterly gone
2015-12-07 22:10:06	SylvieLorxu	>.<
2015-12-07 22:10:08	koz_	Well, in essence, the last panel is what I think really says how I feel.
2015-12-07 22:10:21	tane	well, SylvieLorxu, this is exactly the problem, there's no universal truth to ethics
2015-12-07 22:10:41	fr33domlover	tane, some people would disagree
2015-12-07 22:10:42	SylvieLorxu	That's such a weak excuse
2015-12-07 22:10:55	SylvieLorxu	I mean, if there is no universal truth, at least be consistent
2015-12-07 22:11:09	SylvieLorxu	At least have a good reason why some murder is "okay" and other isn't
2015-12-07 22:11:09	ic2000	best font is wingdings
2015-12-07 22:11:11	koz_	'Our emotions are valid. You don't get to dictate the terms of our activism. You don't get to dictate the ways we can talk about our experiences.'
2015-12-07 22:11:13	ic2000	or whatever it's called
2015-12-07 22:11:16	SylvieLorxu	Why you'd keep a dog as pet and slaughter a cow
2015-12-07 22:11:27	SylvieLorxu	Because those arbitrary lines are just bullshit, frankly
2015-12-07 22:11:33	tane	SylvieLorxu, other people slaughter dogs and have holy cows :)
2015-12-07 22:11:42	ic2000	it's so retarded, in school we used to change the peoples fonts into wingdings to piss em off :)
2015-12-07 22:11:53	SylvieLorxu	Exactly, and for equally vague reasons
2015-12-07 22:12:01	SylvieLorxu	Nobody can tell me why they keep a dog as pet and kill a cow
2015-12-07 22:12:03	SylvieLorxu	Literally nobody
2015-12-07 22:12:09	SylvieLorxu	If you make a seperation, at least have a reason
2015-12-07 22:12:26	tane	well, better than slaughter them all, eh?
2015-12-07 22:13:08	SylvieLorxu	That's completely irrelevant and just a bad attempt to avoid discussing the issue at hand
2015-12-07 22:13:27	SylvieLorxu	I've had that trick pulled on me too often to fall for it as well
2015-12-07 22:13:33	tane	well, the issues here have cultural and historic reasons, obviously
2015-12-07 22:13:53	fr33domlover	tane, those are not enough, not even close
2015-12-07 22:13:57	SylvieLorxu	Cultural and historic reasons which obviously are no longer relevant
2015-12-07 22:14:03	fr33domlover	"i do this because my parents did this" etc.
2015-12-07 22:14:04	dimkr	o/
2015-12-07 22:14:09	fr33domlover	dimkr, o/
2015-12-07 22:14:14	dimkr	does anyone have a good example of a personal site?
2015-12-07 22:14:14	SylvieLorxu	Otherwise people could tell me why they feel a dog's life is worth more than a cow's life
2015-12-07 22:14:22	dimkr	I want to redesign my portfolio
2015-12-07 22:14:43	SylvieLorxu	dimkr: http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/, as francis7 linked before
2015-12-07 22:15:10	tane	SylvieLorxu, well, that's a hard question to answer in general. Have you worked on a farm at some point in your life?
2015-12-07 22:15:44	dimkr	SylvieLorxu, lol
2015-12-07 22:16:01	SylvieLorxu	No, but my mom keeps sheep which has let me experience first-hand sheep and dog are basically the exact same
2015-12-07 22:16:40	tane	how's that?
2015-12-07 22:16:47	koz_	They're both adorable.
2015-12-07 22:16:53	SylvieLorxu	One may growl, the other may drag a hoof over the ground, but the range of emotions and the way they experience it is basically the exact same
2015-12-07 22:17:22	SylvieLorxu	In fact, there are many places where humans are the same
2015-12-07 22:17:36	tane	so you extrapolate from your own experience?
2015-12-07 22:17:42	SylvieLorxu	If a stranger comes to you in a threatening stance, it doesn't matter if you're a dog, a cow or a human
2015-12-07 22:18:03	SylvieLorxu	Do you have anything more valuable then?
2015-12-07 22:18:18	SylvieLorxu	Because you asked me if I worked on a farm, which is clearly a question of personal experience
2015-12-07 22:18:44	tane	yes, that was directed at the worth associated with different kinds of animals though. but nevertheless, thank you for the answer
2015-12-07 22:21:19	SylvieMobile	Me: "Oh hey this JS code works, time to deploy"

2015-12-09 21:26:08	Jookia	ic2000_: use msys2
2015-12-09 21:26:17	Jookia	ic2000_: it has a linux package manager from arch linux + native windows tools

2015-12-09 21:26:44	Jookia	ic2000_: as for whether you should use curses or create a terminal look using a GUI, its up to you - whichever's more fun
2015-12-09 21:27:06	ic2000_	Jookia, well it being terminal would make  alot more sense
2015-12-09 21:27:14	ic2000_	but i wamted to reinvent it for fun
2015-12-09 21:28:32	ic2000_	well

2015-12-10 20:21:23	vaeringjar	hm, thanks for telling me
2015-12-10 20:21:27	ic2000_	Jookia, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
2015-12-10 20:21:31	ic2000_	nothing that involves netowrks
2015-12-10 20:21:33	ic2000_	or shit like that
2015-12-10 20:21:43	Jookia	ic2000_: what can it involve?
2015-12-10 20:21:56	ic2000_	Jookia, nothing web related, nothing network related
2015-12-10 20:21:58	ic2000_	pls
2015-12-10 20:21:58	Digit	meep
2015-12-10 20:22:08	vaeringjar	that's different from what wolftune ran into... I'd setup my own server, but my connection speeds/reliability are terrible
2015-12-10 20:22:10	ic2000_	 web apps are doable but not my thang
2015-12-10 20:22:12	Jookia	Digit: o/
2015-12-10 20:23:06	vaeringjar	hm... he did end up fixing it though... fr33domlover, we have emailed each other before though. has anything changed on your side?
2015-12-10 20:23:14	Digit	i came here to do two things.  chill out, and burn some coding energy.  n i'm all out of coding energy.  
2015-12-10 20:23:36	vaeringjar	fr33domlover: or do you remember the first time you saw the error?
2015-12-10 20:23:47	fr33domlover	vaeringjar, tl;dr of the email: wekan uses a MongoDB database, hopefully easy to migrate. So far my server can handle the wekan instance so no rush. But if/when there's more boards and visitors etc., maybe it won't so well. So no rush, but tell me when you are ready for a migration. Setting up wekan was easy, there are instructions+script
2015-12-10 20:24:24	fr33domlover	vaeringjar, nothing changed on my side,perhaps except for using a different OpenNIC server :P
2015-12-10 20:24:52	fr33domlover	but if the IP is corret then it shouldn't be the issue
2015-12-10 20:24:56	fr33domlover	*IP address
2015-12-10 20:25:34	Jookia	ic2000_: a better file browser?
2015-12-10 20:25:47	ic2000_	Jookia, in what way wouold it be better?
2015-12-10 20:26:07	 *	Digit uses fish as his file browser, but would like to make better use of xiki for that
2015-12-10 20:26:11	fr33domlover	ic2000_, tell us what your experience level is etc.
2015-12-10 20:26:23	fr33domlover	and then we can suggest things accordingly
2015-12-10 20:26:26	Jookia	ic2000_: i don't know, experiment with shit - maybe it could be 3d, maybe it could work using zooming in rather than clicking on things
2015-12-10 20:26:47	vaeringjar	fr33domlover, oh okay. completely different from what happened with wolftune. for some reason my host has blacklisted you. =p
2015-12-10 20:27:11	fr33domlover	vaeringjar, maybe because i don't have a PTR record?
2015-12-10 20:27:12	ic2000_	fr33domlover, for now just make it something simple, nothing too basic it at least needs to show somewhat skill and time needs to be put in it
2015-12-10 20:27:46	fr33domlover	ic2000_, this is /way/ too general
2015-12-10 20:27:47	Jookia	ic2000_: sounds like any programming project
2015-12-10 20:27:53	fr33domlover	ic2000_, be more specific :P
2015-12-10 20:28:00	ic2000_	fr33domlover, what parts about my experience do u wanna know
2015-12-10 20:28:04	fr33domlover	e.g. make a list of prime numbers
2015-12-10 20:28:09	fr33domlover	VS develop a kernel
2015-12-10 20:28:19	fr33domlover	where are you in that wide range :P
2015-12-10 20:28:22	fr33domlover	*?
2015-12-10 20:28:26	vaeringjar	fr33domlover, perhaps. I need to email them... kinda getting frustrated with them...
2015-12-10 20:28:38	 *	Digit makes a list of prime numbers, 1...................  0_0
2015-12-10 20:28:51	fr33domlover	vaeringjar, g00gle users get/got my mail in their spam folder
2015-12-10 20:28:58	fr33domlover	so no surprise i suppose...
2015-12-10 20:29:19	Jookia	ic2000_: here's the secret: it's more important to combine things to make new things than it is to make existing things unless you have a good reason/want to experiment. an IRC bot for example could use an IRC library- the whole point is to put your own personal twist on it
2015-12-10 20:29:59	Jookia	ic2000_: and things that actually help people or fix problems tend to be boring to show off since you have to explain the problem to people and by that time they're bore
2015-12-10 20:30:01	fr33domlover	but last time I checked, my IP address wasn't in the big anti-spam companies' blacklists
2015-12-10 20:30:05	fr33domlover	i hope it didn't change
2015-12-10 20:30:58	ic2000_	Jookia, well unless somebody will show me how to make an IRC 
2015-12-10 20:30:59	ic2000_	bot
2015-12-10 20:31:36	Jookia	ic2000_: there's tutorials out there, existing bots to look at, but generally the way to learn to do things is to just try it and hit problems
2015-12-10 20:32:01	ic2000_	Jookia, i tried some time ago in python. didn't work i googled a lot but no hope
2015-12-10 20:32:11	ic2000_	  so no i don;t like networks yet an yway
2015-12-10 20:32:35	Jookia	ic2000_: that's fine, i'm a networking nerd at this point anyway
2015-12-10 20:33:47	ic2000_	so a file manager
2015-12-10 20:33:59	◀▬▬	h0wl3vvd (~h0wl@unaffiliated/h0wl3vvd) has left #freepost ("ERC Version 5.3 (IRC client for Emacs)")

2015-12-10 20:35:25	ic2000_	Jookia, tui or gui
2015-12-10 20:35:28	SylvieLorxu	I made an IRC bot in Python using the Twisted IRC libraries before
2015-12-10 20:35:30	SylvieLorxu	That was nice
2015-12-10 20:35:42	Jookia	ic2000_: up to you, either way there's cool ways to represent data
2015-12-10 20:37:28	Jookia	"You must not send any email message via SMTP that is sent using a server other than the [ISP] SMTP server." are you fucking kidding me
2015-12-10 20:37:46	ic2000_	Jookia, any other project ideas
2015-12-10 20:38:40	fr33domlover	ic2000_, what is the most complicated thing you wrote?
2015-12-10 20:39:29	ic2000_	fr33domlover, ehh ages ago i started making a really poorly coded rpg engine in flash
2015-12-10 20:39:33	ic2000_	i stopped though
2015-12-10 20:39:43	Jookia	ic2000_: make a text adventure that doesn't suck
2015-12-10 20:39:57	ic2000_	nah text adventures too boring imo
2015-12-10 20:40:02	ic2000_	needs some sort of interaction
2015-12-10 20:40:08	Jookia	a roguelike then?
2015-12-10 20:40:36	ic2000_	possibly that was already on my idea list but i have no experience with that
2015-12-10 20:40:38	ic2000_	would need help
2015-12-10 20:40:54	Jookia	ic2000_: there's a site called roguebasin that has some tips
2015-12-10 20:40:55	ic2000_	if it was terminal at least
2015-12-10 20:41:36	ic2000_	the thing i'm most concerned about with roguelikes is
2015-12-10 20:42:27	SylvieLorxu	There's a game engine for roguelikes
2015-12-10 20:42:32	SylvieLorxu	Brogue was written in it, for example
2015-12-10 20:42:33	ic2000_	http://screenshots.debian.net/screenshots/c/crawl/1023_large.png
2015-12-10 20:42:41	ic2000_	i'd want to crearte my own engine
2015-12-10 20:42:47	ic2000_	see the text
2015-12-10 20:43:04	ic2000_	how would u make it so u could have organised text and shit
2015-12-10 20:43:29	Jookia	however you want. maybe you'd just use rectangles to draw like any GUI?
2015-12-10 20:44:05	SylvieLorxu	If you want to use text, you'll need to make sure to use a fixed-width font
2015-12-10 20:44:13	SylvieLorxu	That's basically the only thing
2015-12-10 20:44:23	ic2000_	something once suggested me
2015-12-10 20:44:25	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: ehh
2015-12-10 20:44:31	ic2000_	make a engine which isn't related to the UI
2015-12-10 20:44:39	ic2000_	so it can be used with whatever UI u wanrt
2015-12-10 20:44:40	ic2000_	t
2015-12-10 20:44:46	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: that's very anglo-saxon
2015-12-10 20:45:03	Jookia	ic2000_: i use to think that, but just make your game logic not related to the UI and have your UI call it
2015-12-10 20:45:25	vaeringjar	fr33domlover, I submitted a request to my host. I'll let you know what I come up with. 
2015-12-10 20:46:09	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: basically halfwidth and fullwidth forms are what you want to handle
2015-12-10 20:46:50	SylvieLorxu	Hmm@s
2015-12-10 20:46:57	SylvieLorxu	Well, if you say so
2015-12-10 20:47:08	SylvieLorxu	I wrote a text adventure to not have to deal with this :P
2015-12-10 20:47:47	Jookia	haha
2015-12-10 20:48:11	Jookia	Time to set up PGP on Mutt
2015-12-10 20:48:16	Jookia	:(
2015-12-10 20:50:19	Jookia	use gpg pizzaiolo said, it'd be easy pizzaiolo said
2015-12-10 20:50:41	pizzaiolo	Jookia: what happen !!
2015-12-10 20:50:47	Jookia	gpg not work
2015-12-10 20:50:48	pizzaiolo	someone set us up the bomb
2015-12-10 20:51:01	pizzaiolo	Jookia: watch snowden's tutorial
2015-12-10 20:51:05	pizzaiolo	maybe it'll help
2015-12-10 20:51:10	Jookia	pizzaiolo: does it cover nixos + mutt + CLI
2015-12-10 20:51:35	pizzaiolo	Jookia: it covers the basics of pgp
2015-12-10 20:51:47	pizzaiolo	to be fair your setup is very nonstandard
2015-12-10 20:54:18	Jookia	is that fail
2015-12-10 20:54:20	Jookia	fair*
2015-12-10 20:58:08	Jookia	wow gpg is broken o my machine
2015-12-10 21:04:42	Jookia	well i guess gpg is broken for me
2015-12-10 21:04:53	Jookia	time to tell the one person i used GPG with that i can't read her mail

2015-12-10 22:18:46	fr33domlover	Jookia, afaik you need to (1) generate your GPG key (2) publish to a server if you like (3) know how to fetch keys of other people from keyservers (4) make Mutt use GPG, someone probably already wrote a tutorial somewhere...
2015-12-10 22:24:08	Jookia	fr33domlover: I think it may be a gpg version mismatch issue- I'm compiling gpg2.1 to see if it fixes it

2015-12-10 22:30:58	Jookia	koz_: it's fine, i'd rather invest in something like bitmessage
2015-12-10 22:31:16	koz_	Jookia: Well, fair enough. I basically GPG with like, about 2 people.
2015-12-10 22:31:29	Jookia	morning btw
2015-12-10 22:31:41	Jookia	i'd have to write some scripts for bitmessage to use maildir or IMAP or whatever
2015-12-10 22:31:51	SylvieMobile	koz_: 3 people
2015-12-10 22:32:26	koz_	SylvieMobile: OK, 3.
2015-12-10 22:32:31	koz_	Single-digit number, essentially.
2015-12-10 22:33:06	SylvieMobile	I actually have no clue if I was included in your first count
2015-12-10 22:33:23	SylvieMobile	Or if you know why I count you as using GPG with me :P
2015-12-10 22:33:27	koz_	SylvieMobile: I'm not 100% sure either - I don't keep an exact mental list of who I GPG with.
2015-12-10 22:34:20	SylvieMobile	Anyway, Kontalk uses GPG, so yeah
2015-12-10 22:34:56	SylvieMobile	Which is why I use GPG with like 20 people lol
2015-12-10 22:34:57	koz_	My Kontalk key wouldn't be the same as my mail key then.

2015-12-10 22:52:25	fr33domlover	the server is constantly on high CPU usage suddenly, and it's wekan's fault

2015-12-10 23:10:21	koz_	So Sylvie is the goddess of fries, from-source compilation and encryption?
2015-12-10 23:10:29	koz_	I'll remember to pray to you every time code fails to build.
2015-12-10 23:11:34	SylvieMobile	Honestly, if there's anything to be a goddess of, those sound like the best things
2015-12-10 23:11:51	SylvieMobile	Who needs a goddess of love or courage or trade or whatever
2015-12-10 23:12:11	SylvieMobile	Fries, from-source compilation and encryption is where it's at
2015-12-10 23:12:42	koz_	SylvieMobile: http://paste.rel4tion.org/167
2015-12-10 23:12:53	koz_	Needs a bit of work.
2015-12-10 23:13:39	koz_	Actually, I already have edits.
2015-12-10 23:13:39	SylvieMobile	Queendom
2015-12-10 23:13:46	SylvieMobile	Kingdom is lame
2015-12-10 23:14:41	koz_	I made it better: http://paste.rel4tion.org/167
2015-12-10 23:14:48	koz_	But I like your idea more. Fixing.
2015-12-10 23:15:09	koz_	OK, fixed to 'queendom'.
2015-12-10 23:15:16	SylvieMobile	Lol
2015-12-10 23:15:41	koz_	The Sylvie Prayer.

2015-12-10 23:16:51	 *	koz_ cues religious debates about the most correct way to eat fries if you are a Sylvist.
2015-12-10 23:18:25	SylvieMobile	Lol
2015-12-10 23:18:47	koz_	(Sylvist, Sylvite, Sylvim?)
2015-12-10 23:19:04	koz_	Sylvim <- has to be this one, obv
2015-12-10 23:21:27	SylvieMobile	Haha
2015-12-10 23:22:21	koz_	Although -im is the Hebrew plural form.
2015-12-10 23:22:39	koz_	fr33domlover: Singular form for 'Sylvim', assuming it existed, according to Hebrew grammar please?

2015-12-10 23:25:34	SylvieMobile	8AM train, that one is always so full and uncomfortable
2015-12-10 23:25:43	SylvieMobile	Pun not intended lol
2015-12-10 23:25:47	koz_	Well, actually, no, I can't deal with the Second Commandment. So someone else will have to be a Sylv. Next time I run any fantasy RPG, I'm gonn have a deity there named Sylvie Lorxu.
2015-12-10 23:25:50	SylvieMobile	But yeah, I guess
2015-12-10 23:26:41	SylvieMobile	I'm so looking forward to "nickname already in use" errors
2015-12-10 23:26:56	koz_	Lol, assuming whatever I do gets this popular!
2015-12-10 23:27:09	 *	Jookia has never had nickname in use errors
2015-12-10 23:27:13	SylvieMobile	Anyway, 8AM train sucks, but the last few days were quite good, so I'm not going to let it ruin my streak
2015-12-10 23:27:22	SylvieMobile	Wait, phrasing
2015-12-10 23:27:23	SylvieMobile	Err

2015-12-10 23:28:26	fr33domlover	my web server seems to get a bit more than 1 request per second
2015-12-10 23:28:30	Jookia	innuendos then
2015-12-10 23:28:32	vaeringjar	fr33domlover, I got lost. do they have install instructions?
2015-12-10 23:28:33	fr33domlover	all going to the wekan app

2015-12-10 23:28:47	Jookia	SylvieMobile: o
2015-12-10 23:28:49	fr33domlover	vaeringjar, yes. there is a script you can run
2015-12-10 23:28:52	SylvieMobile	I really just want to turn it off/shut it down
2015-12-10 23:28:53	SylvieMobile	Lol
2015-12-10 23:28:58	fr33domlover	or use docker image if you like
2015-12-10 23:29:01	SylvieMobile	It just takes forever
2015-12-10 23:29:06	SylvieMobile	Eww, Docker
2015-12-10 23:29:23	fr33domlover	or a dedicated VM, whatever you like
2015-12-10 23:29:25	Jookia	If you want containers, use an OS meant for containers, like Nix or Guix
2015-12-10 23:29:43	SylvieMobile	I mean, containers are good but Docker just makes people add outdated software to their stuff
2015-12-10 23:29:47	fr33domlover	Or, install sandstorm: https://sandstorm.io/install/
2015-12-10 23:29:57	fr33domlover	this can be awesome ^
2015-12-10 23:29:58	SylvieMobile	And you get another Windows with all those stupid .DLL files
2015-12-10 23:30:03	SylvieMobile	Sandstorm is Free?
2015-12-10 23:30:12	fr33domlover	yes!
2015-12-10 23:30:14	vaeringjar	yeah, I see the sandstorm and docker stuff. I just don't see how to do it by intself. 
2015-12-10 23:30:21	Jookia	intself?
2015-12-10 23:30:26	vaeringjar	hehe

2015-12-10 23:30:33	SylvieMobile	Wow, that's kinda cool
2015-12-10 23:30:40	SylvieMobile	It seemed proprietary lol
2015-12-10 23:30:44	fr33domlover	vaeringjar, PM?
2015-12-10 23:31:44	Jookia	dia is the best for sketching out ideas
2015-12-10 23:31:50	koz_	Also, Sylvie, does your religion have anything against premarital sex?
2015-12-10 23:31:52	Jookia	it's like a re-arrangable whiteboard
2015-12-10 23:32:46	koz_	Jookia: Never got the hang of Dia, but that's probably because I've never needed diagrams of this sort.
2015-12-10 23:33:02	SylvieMobile	Not if it involves me? :P
2015-12-10 23:33:18	Jookia	koz_: oh, it's okay for diagrams but i'm getting in to the habit of just using it to put lines + text + circles
2015-12-10 23:33:29	SylvieMobile	Dia sounds cool
2015-12-10 23:33:30	Jookia	like a whiteboard but it doesn't suck
2015-12-10 23:33:41	SylvieMobile	Gentoo is almost done
2015-12-10 23:33:47	SylvieMobile	Damn it's being slow

2015-12-10 23:34:56	koz_	Also, SylvieMobile, does your religion have anything against premarital sex?
2015-12-10 23:35:20	SylvieMobile	I answered that question already
2015-12-10 23:35:27	Jookia	koz_ is grilling you here

2015-12-11 00:14:36	fr33domlover	i don't even know what that thing is
2015-12-11 00:14:40	fr33domlover	we-a-boo

2015-12-11 00:15:21	ic2000_	fr33domlover, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFQQALduhzA
2015-12-11 00:15:25	SylvieMobile	But our culture sucks
2015-12-11 00:15:25	koz_	Think of the worst combination of cultural appropriation, lack of understanding and arrogance.
2015-12-11 00:15:27	ic2000_	this should explain in more detail :')
2015-12-11 00:15:28	SylvieMobile	Let's be honest
2015-12-11 00:15:33	koz_	Japan's is no better.
2015-12-11 00:15:43	SylvieMobile	I don't think it's wrong to denounce western culture
2015-12-11 00:15:49	koz_	Because I actually know what it's like, and *all* our lives under it would be ten times worse than they are under our present ones.
2015-12-11 00:16:03	SylvieMobile	To say you should replace it with Japanese, idk
2015-12-11 00:16:05	koz_	Yeah, but claiming Japan's (or their understanding of it, which is flawed *at best) is better is just as stupid.
2015-12-11 00:16:14	koz_	They don't even know what the fuck they're on about.
2015-12-11 00:16:19	SylvieMobile	Every country sucks
2015-12-11 00:16:23	koz_	And Japanese people are just as embarassed of them as we are.
2015-12-11 00:16:57	SylvieMobile	The only cultures I like seem to be those of smaller groups
2015-12-11 00:17:03	SylvieMobile	Minority cultures and stuff
2015-12-11 00:17:10	SylvieMobile	Pop culture seems to be horrible everywhere
2015-12-11 00:17:39	ic2000_	mainstream hiphop culture is worse lol
2015-12-11 00:17:45	SylvieMobile	I don't even like the word culture because so many of them are messed up
2015-12-11 00:18:10	koz_	Well, I basically go as follows - I keep what I like, ditch the rest.
2015-12-11 00:18:15	koz_	Which is to say I ditch most things.

2015-12-12 21:59:32	SylvieLorxu	koz_: Random bit of curiousity, do you know anything about sending SMS over the Internet? There are a tons of APIs but nobody seems to want to tell you what happens behind the scenes and I want to see if there's a cheaper solution possible if I cut out the middleman
2015-12-12 21:59:54	SylvieLorxu	Just figured that, of all people, you are most likely to have any clue at all
2015-12-12 22:00:10	koz_	SylvieLorxu: Fraid not - this is *well* outside my area of expertise, and indeed, area of interest.
2015-12-12 22:00:13	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: You'd have to find a service that peers with the telephone network
2015-12-12 22:00:22	fr33domlover	SylvieLorxu, you need a message center connected to the mobile network for that
2015-12-12 22:00:27	fr33domlover	you can't do that with just a computer
2015-12-12 22:01:07	fr33domlover	afaik there is no home-made way to send SMS from the internet
2015-12-12 22:01:11	Jookia	The telephone network is one giant set of switches + routers with no security- if you can get a center connected to the network you can spy on basically anyone accessible from the network
2015-12-12 22:01:22	fr33domlover	you need some corp running such a server to send it for you etc.
2015-12-12 22:02:22	fr33domlover	SylvieLorxu, however you already have such a corp: the one providing your mobile phone
2015-12-12 22:02:46	fr33domlover	what if you made an SMS sending web server implemented using a regular cellphone? :P

2015-12-12 22:16:27	SylvieLorxu	fr33domlover: I'd at least want to directly use my provider than, not something like Twilio. Also, 10 cents per message is ridiculous

2015-12-12 22:16:38	koz_	SylvieLorxu: How many are you looking at sending?
2015-12-12 22:16:50	koz_	Also, that *is* ridiculous - doesn't your provider have a plan for that?
2015-12-12 22:17:16	SylvieLorxu	koz_: No specific amount, I'm just looking into it to see if I can implement SMS notifications in a cost-efficient way so people could opt-in for it if they'd prefer it

2015-12-13 00:04:47	JamesJRH	The email leaves it sounding rather mysterious, though, and doesn't mention the Major Escalation campaign, so maybe this is something else, something extra, between now and then.
2015-12-13 00:06:46	JamesJRH	Actually, it's definitely something else. I just read it again: “This begins the next chapter. Please watch this space for the announcement of something big in the coming days!”

2015-12-13 00:41:25	JamesJRH	The circle of hook-and-loop is to hold the cap back in fingerless mode, in mitten mode, there is no need for any fastener due to that the cap/flap is over your fingers.

The convertible bit was irrelevant, the effect is the same as if I'm wearing normal fingerless gloves.
2015-12-13 00:45:12	JamesJRH	It's not because I'm cold.
2015-12-13 00:45:58	JamesJRH	It's because I'm getting a pressure point on my wrist, and it's growing extra bone, apparently.
2015-12-13 00:46:19	Jookia	ic2000: it's a website for freely downloadable music (legal) under creative commons licenses
2015-12-13 00:46:21	JamesJRH	According to my mum, who's a doctor.
2015-12-13 00:46:53	JamesJRH	It is increasingly being saw, and apparently that stimulates growth of the bone.
2015-12-13 00:47:07	ic2000	Jookia, do u only listen to music under that a certain license?
2015-12-13 00:47:37	JamesJRH	Which makes it into a lump, which gets more pressure, which gets sorer, which becomes a bigger lump, and so on.
2015-12-13 00:48:32	JamesJRH	And I don't like this thought, so I'm wanting to try to stop it now that I've noticed this effect, before it gets more difficult to stop.
2015-12-13 00:48:44	Jookia	ic2000: koz does, though i'm not that cool. free culture isn't that far yet like free software (if you can call it far :P), so i don't have only free music in my collection. the licenses are shown on freedomdefined.org or something. it's a really new movement compared to free software
2015-12-13 00:49:26	JamesJRH	So the standard solution is to use a wrist rest, but I find those annoying or impractical.
2015-12-13 00:49:35	ic2000	Jookia, fair enough. i think the idea of freedom music is cool but i don't think it's like, that important

2015-12-13 00:50:19	Jookia	ic2000: believe it or not, a lot of people here would agree with you (and almost tons in the free software movement, even richard stallman)
2015-12-13 00:51:50	JamesJRH	So I wondered: well maybe I could attach the needed padding to my wrists… then I realised that wearing my convertible mittens in fingerless-glove mode would achieve that, whilst still being able to type.
2015-12-13 00:52:13	JamesJRH	It seems to be going okay so far, though I may need to revise that.

2015-12-13 00:59:55	SylvieLorxu	Jookia: lol, no. The thing is, I wrote some system that uses OpenStreetMaps geocoding and then caches the lat/long of a location to the database. However, they were calling that function every time the application started with a newly generated location, so it couldn't cache it, and we made a unnecessary request to the OSM servers every time we started the application (which happens a LOT when developing
2015-12-13 00:59:58	SylvieLorxu	it) and, well, that made me realize why the map randomly started failing: temp ban from the geocoding server for making the same request over and over for no reason...
2015-12-13 01:00:02	JamesJRH	Jookia: These are excellent: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneel_chair
2015-12-13 01:01:22	SylvieLorxu	So I commented out that line, put a 10-line warning about how you should never call my function like that or kittens die, pushed it straight to the main development branch and yelled at everyone to merge it into their branch ASAP

2015-12-13 01:05:42	JamesJRH	Lol.
2015-12-13 01:05:56	JamesJRH	Hmm.
2015-12-13 01:06:11	JamesJRH	I've just thought…
2015-12-13 01:08:59	JamesJRH	In code, how we have ‘# TODO:’ comments and ‘# FIXME:’ comments (which Vim and other editors have built-in highlighting for), I might also start writing ‘# TEST:’ comments.
2015-12-13 01:09:00	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: hmm
2015-12-13 01:09:25	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: the only way i could've thought to fix this would be to make a new function that does the caching then calls the old one, since it's a change in behaviour
2015-12-13 01:09:30	JamesJRH	Things like those test printf statements in a Bash script and such.
2015-12-13 01:10:39	SylvieLorxu	Jookia: Nah, they should just call the function with a location object that's connected to the database
2015-12-13 01:10:52	SylvieLorxu	Instead of creating a new disconnected object on the fly each run
2015-12-13 01:11:18	SylvieLorxu	On that note, I wonder what other programming languages have something which works like "Entity Framework"
2015-12-13 01:11:22	SylvieLorxu	Because it is fairly useful
2015-12-13 01:11:34	SylvieLorxu	Probably all
2015-12-13 01:12:51	SylvieLorxu	I remember doing something similar in Python
2015-12-13 01:12:51	JamesJRH	My use of ‘# TEST:’ would be such that stripping all or any lines containing it does not break the production functionality. That's sort of a definition for it.
2015-12-13 01:13:18	Jookia	JamesJRH: i'd certainy like to get in to the habit of putting tests in the same file as my code
2015-12-13 01:13:22	SylvieLorxu	Basically, a way to save objects to the database and read them from the database, so normal objects start to persist
2015-12-13 01:13:41	SylvieLorxu	Microsoft has a fancy name for it called "Entity Framework"
2015-12-13 01:13:51	SylvieLorxu	Which is horribly complicated to set up, but after that works nicely
2015-12-13 01:13:57	SylvieLorxu	I just wonder how it's called in other languages
2015-12-13 01:14:03	Jookia	'persist'?
2015-12-13 01:14:44	SylvieLorxu	So, you load a Dog object from the database, and if you change Dog.Color then that'll be saved in the database too
2015-12-13 01:14:45	SylvieLorxu	Stuff like that
2015-12-13 01:14:48	JamesJRH	Jookia: These aren't things that should be committed; these are WIP sort of things.
2015-12-13 01:15:01	SylvieLorxu	Instead of writing SQL queries you just work with the objects
2015-12-13 01:15:05	JamesJRH	I often put a printf somewhere as a probe.
2015-12-13 01:15:10	SylvieLorxu	And the framework does the queries abstractly in the background
2015-12-13 01:15:12	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: object relational stuff
2015-12-13 01:15:29	Jookia	JamesJRH: tests are stuff that should be commited, but having complexity where we need to printf stuff is troubling too
2015-12-13 01:15:51	SylvieLorxu	Oh, ORM
2015-12-13 01:17:19	SylvieLorxu	Yup, Entity Framework is literally just an ORM
2015-12-13 01:17:22	JamesJRH	Jookia: I know, but then so are ‘# TODO:’'s and ‘# FIXME:’'s. ‘# TEST:’ is not really any worse than that.

2015-12-13 01:23:17	koz_	JamesJRH: Because OO is based on shit and relational databases on set theory and logic.
2015-12-13 01:23:21	JamesJRH	00:21:30 < koz_> JamesJRH: ORMs are basically 'how OO ruins databases'.  ← I'm not a fan of object-oriented programming in general, though. Let alone for databases.
2015-12-13 01:23:33	JamesJRH	Heh, yeah. :-)
2015-12-13 01:23:35	Jookia	i like OO
2015-12-13 01:23:41	koz_	OO is shit.
2015-12-13 01:23:43	JamesJRH	o_O
2015-12-13 01:23:44	Jookia	if by OO we mean actual OO
2015-12-13 01:23:46	Jookia	not java OO
2015-12-13 01:23:49	koz_	It has zero benefits that aren't given by something else.
2015-12-13 01:23:54	koz_	And nobody even knows what it means anyhow.
2015-12-13 01:23:55	JamesJRH	O_o
2015-12-13 01:24:04	koz_	Ask 10 different people and they'll answer it ten different ways.
2015-12-13 01:24:14	Jookia	koz_: well, message passing - OO can be useful at the system level. like in erlang
2015-12-13 01:24:37	Jookia	basically by OO i mean 'isolate parts of the system and their communications'
2015-12-13 01:24:52	JamesJRH	O_O
2015-12-13 01:25:01	JamesJRH	OOOOOOOOOOOh…
2015-12-13 01:25:04	JamesJRH	:-P
2015-12-13 01:25:05	Jookia	it's useful for things like fault tolerant networks
2015-12-13 01:25:25	Jookia	and clusters
2015-12-13 01:25:41	koz_	Jookia: That's not OO. That's 'not being a retard chipmunk'.
2015-12-13 01:25:51	JamesJRH	:-)
2015-12-13 01:25:51	koz_	Seriously.
2015-12-13 01:26:00	Jookia	koz_: hmm, i submit that. i wonder what the term is for that
2015-12-13 01:26:07	koz_	Exactly what I said.
2015-12-13 01:26:15	koz_	But yeah, ORMs are for dumb people who can't logic.
2015-12-13 01:26:27	koz_	Although I admit that it's not the easiest thing in the world.
2015-12-13 01:26:28	JamesJRH	:-/
2015-12-13 01:26:28	Jookia	i dunno, sylvie's pretty cool
2015-12-13 01:26:49	JamesJRH	koz_: Don't call Sylvie that!
2015-12-13 01:27:37	Jookia	sylvie's pretty cool with how she handles the stuff we don't have to
2015-12-13 01:27:41	Jookia	mad props to her
2015-12-13 01:28:33	SylvieLorxu	ORMs do introduce a lot of risks, but they can simplify a lot too
2015-12-13 01:28:42	SylvieLorxu	I mean, there are definitely issues with it
2015-12-13 01:28:56	SylvieLorxu	But I can see this one day becoming a great thing
2015-12-13 01:29:01	SylvieLorxu	Abstraction isn't bad by default
2015-12-13 01:29:10	SylvieLorxu	It only becomes a problem when you can't get rid of it when you need to
2015-12-13 01:29:11	koz_	What's more abstract than logic?
2015-12-13 01:29:57	JamesJRH	To me, it sounds like ORM is OO programming that is seamlessly able to use a database to represent its internal state, but persistently.
2015-12-13 01:30:09	koz_	JamesJRH: So a terrible thing being made less-terrible?
2015-12-13 01:30:24	SylvieLorxu	JamesJRH: Basically, yes
2015-12-13 01:30:38	JamesJRH	To me, ORM is no worse than OO; it is OO that's the real issue.
2015-12-13 01:30:39	SylvieLorxu	The risks of ORMs is storing your data is a very application-specific way
2015-12-13 01:30:42	JamesJRH	koz_: Indeed.
2015-12-13 01:30:42	koz_	Again, if you cut OO out of the equation, you no longer need to solve the problem.
2015-12-13 01:30:49	SylvieLorxu	Like, some ORMs don't do that
2015-12-13 01:30:54	Jookia	i dunno
2015-12-13 01:30:55	SylvieLorxu	But if you use Entity Framework, for example
2015-12-13 01:31:05	Jookia	the main flaw with OO is that you can't compose things
2015-12-13 01:31:09	SylvieLorxu	It tends to store it in such a way that makes it pretty tough to use in non-C# projects
2015-12-13 01:31:26	koz_	The main flaw with OO is that it's not founded on anything sane, well-defined or well-founded.
2015-12-13 01:31:33	koz_	It's a bunch of fuzzy intuition.
2015-12-13 01:31:52	Jookia	http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/08/the-category-design-pattern.html is a great read and why i like functional programming
2015-12-13 01:31:56	koz_	Procedural programming is founded on Turing machines. Functional on the lambda calculus and model theory.
2015-12-13 01:32:04	koz_	OO has ... nothing.
2015-12-13 01:32:11	Jookia	that's interesting
2015-12-13 01:32:25	koz_	Because it's basically the programming equivalent of snake oil and got where it did by exploiting misconceptions.
2015-12-13 01:32:50	Jookia	koz_: did you know guix uses monads? :D
2015-12-13 01:32:58	koz_	Jookia: Wouldn't surprise me.
2015-12-13 01:33:16	Jookia	and so does that functional javascript thing you sent me a while back
2015-12-13 01:33:24	koz_	Again, wouldn't surprise me.
2015-12-13 01:33:25	Jookia	it's nice to see these things bleed in to other languages
2015-12-13 01:33:49	koz_	Well, people are discovering that functional programming had important ideas now, because OO breaks down totally in the face of concurrency or parallelism.
2015-12-13 01:34:05	koz_	Whatever definition of it you choose to take.
2015-12-13 01:34:14	JamesJRH	Jookia: Interesting.
2015-12-13 01:34:20	koz_	Mostly because fuzzy intuition fails to hold once we abandon a linear-time logic of program execution.
2015-12-13 01:34:29	koz_	(or rather, a fuzzy intuition of linear-time logic)
2015-12-13 01:34:54	Jookia	JamesJRH: koz_: SylvieLorxu: oops, i mean http://www.haskellforall.com/2014/04/scalable-program-architectures.html
2015-12-13 01:35:34	Jookia	i think that nails why i think OO and FP are fundamentally different
2015-12-13 01:35:37	SylvieLorxu	The conventional architecture requires layering abstraction on top of abstraction:
2015-12-13 01:35:39	SylvieLorxu	    Oh no, these Bs are not connectable, so let's make a network of Bs and call that a C.
2015-12-13 01:35:41	SylvieLorxu	    Well, I want to assemble several Cs, so let's make a network of Cs and call that a D
2015-12-13 01:35:43	SylvieLorxu	    ...
2015-12-13 01:35:45	SylvieLorxu	Wash, rinse, and repeat until you have an unmanageable tower of abstractions.
2015-12-13 01:35:47	SylvieLorxu	This so badly.
2015-12-13 01:35:54	Jookia	:v
2015-12-13 01:35:56	SylvieLorxu	We have an User object, an UserVM, an UserListVM
2015-12-13 01:36:04	SylvieLorxu	And this is pretty normal OO stuff
2015-12-13 01:36:16	SylvieLorxu	3 layers for an user object.
2015-12-13 01:36:24	SylvieLorxu	All with minimal difference
2015-12-13 01:36:36	Jookia	its not great
2015-12-13 01:37:17	SylvieLorxu	I... don't understand the Haskell examples
2015-12-13 01:37:23	SylvieLorxu	But that's probably because I'm way too used to OO
2015-12-13 01:37:28	SylvieLorxu	I'd definitely love to learn this once, though
2015-12-13 01:37:39	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: they're pretty deep ML syntax and typeclasses are different to actual classes
2015-12-13 01:38:14	Jookia	koz_: oh, that post happens to explain the difference between functors/monads
2015-12-13 01:38:17	Jookia	uhh
2015-12-13 01:38:19	Jookia	applicatives/monads
2015-12-13 01:39:10	koz_	SylvieLorxu: It's not the easiest thing to get your head around sometimes, I'll admit.
2015-12-13 01:39:53	Jookia	koz_ is the latest haskell convert :P
2015-12-13 01:41:31	koz_	Well, again, I have a background in logic and computer science.
2015-12-13 01:41:46	koz_	For me, Haskell is pretty much what I should use, because it means I can just go with what I intuitively understand.
2015-12-13 01:41:50	koz_	Well, for the most part.
2015-12-13 01:41:57	koz_	I sometimes feel I didn't do enough model theory for this language. :P
2015-12-13 01:42:43	turtleman_	im trying to get into haskell
2015-12-13 01:42:59	turtleman_	maybe if i reprogram my autokey cipher in it, ill get the gist
2015-12-13 01:43:04	turtleman_	i think thats when i started to get scheme
2015-12-13 01:43:35	SylvieLorxu	I understand OO semi-decently
2015-12-13 01:43:50	SylvieLorxu	But no matter how much teacher keep teaching it, I always have points where I just get completely confused
2015-12-13 01:43:54	SylvieLorxu	And make a small mistake
2015-12-13 01:43:57	koz_	turtleman_: If you come from Scheme, you'll find it easier than most.
2015-12-13 01:43:58	SylvieLorxu	And then the whole structure is ruined
2015-12-13 01:44:12	SylvieLorxu	And the application slowly becomes unmaintainable
2015-12-13 01:44:13	koz_	Eh, there's nothign to get. It means whatever you want it to mean.
2015-12-13 01:44:26	turtleman_	i dont think OO is very well-defined
2015-12-13 01:44:38	koz_	That's why it becomes unmaintainable - it's only valid when the complexity is inherently low enough to not require structure (i.e. toy examples).
2015-12-13 01:46:26	turtleman_	in school i learned that OO is: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction
2015-12-13 01:46:33	turtleman_	but you can have all those things without OO
2015-12-13 01:46:41	turtleman_	and ive heard arguments you can have OO without some of those
2015-12-13 01:47:09	Jookia	i dont think there's a real definition of OO
2015-12-13 01:47:17	Jookia	or rather, OO tends to come with a lot of vague ideas
2015-12-13 01:47:31	Jookia	the problem is
2015-12-13 01:47:42	Jookia	the things you learned what OO is is all about solving issues you get with 'objects'
2015-12-13 01:47:50	Jookia	which fundamentally combines code and data
2015-12-13 01:48:18	Jookia	100 functions with one struct is better than 10 objects with 10 methods each
2015-12-13 01:48:26	koz_	Thanks ALan Perlis!
2015-12-13 01:48:38	koz_	But yeah, OO means absolutely nothing, because it's not well-defined.
2015-12-13 01:48:51	Jookia	i read that alan key defines it as message passing
2015-12-13 01:49:18	turtleman_	objects are always described as "nouns" but on the other hand, some people say "objects are only useful once you break out of objects-as-nouns"
2015-12-13 01:49:29	turtleman_	"dog is not a class"
2015-12-13 01:49:56	turtleman_	smalltalk has influences from the actor model
2015-12-13 01:50:02	turtleman_	i never learned it too well
2015-12-13 01:50:06	Jookia	i feel like OO is terrible in that it tries to specify objectively what something is
2015-12-13 01:50:26	Jookia	you almost never want to know what something is, but rather, what it's good for
2015-12-13 01:50:29	 *	JamesJRH has just finished reading: http://www.haskellforall.com/2014/04/scalable-program-architectures.html
2015-12-13 01:50:30	koz_	Eh, it's terrible because nobody knows what it is, and it only works in trivial cases.
2015-12-13 01:50:39	Jookia	JamesJRH: woo
2015-12-13 01:50:39	JamesJRH	Wow, nice article. :-)
2015-12-13 01:50:49	Jookia	koz_: you should read that link if you didn't :D
2015-12-13 01:51:08	koz_	Jookia: I will at some point.
2015-12-13 01:51:16	koz_	But anyways, haskell4lyf.
2015-12-13 01:51:45	Jookia	koz_: if you're okay with strictness and you want to play more with types, idris is a good research language for these things
2015-12-13 01:52:04	koz_	I'll get Haskell into my brain first.
2015-12-13 01:53:08	Jookia	koz_: FSF sent me an email in markdown btw
2015-12-13 01:53:32	koz_	Oh?
2015-12-13 01:53:45	koz_	Were you expecting something different or something?
2015-12-13 01:53:58	Jookia	koz_: I just haven't seen it before and think it's brilliant
2015-12-13 01:54:50	JamesJRH	Jookia: That has helped me touch-up on my understanding of monoid, monad, and applicative, actually. A few months ago, I finally grasped the concept of monads (but not until I saw the category theory explanation), and Gabriel's explanations help fit that new understanding in with monoid and applicative, which I hadn't really thought about since my breakthrough with monads.
2015-12-13 01:55:22	koz_	JamesJRH: Monads are something that can be a bit mind-bending.
2015-12-13 01:55:24	JamesJRH	Category theory is the way to approach those concepts, not arrows and do notation.
2015-12-13 01:55:38	koz_	Category theory *is* the way, but I don't know enough logic I think.
2015-12-13 01:55:43	koz_	Well, it's model theory actually.
2015-12-13 01:55:43	Jookia	JamesJRH: oh what?
2015-12-13 01:55:48	koz_	But model theory is logic.
2015-12-13 01:56:05	Jookia	koz_: also you totally figured out monads super fast, i had to read the 'you could have invented monads' article
2015-12-13 01:56:42	JamesJRH	Start with do-notation and monads are mind-bending; start with category theory and monads are a piece of cake.
2015-12-13 01:56:42	koz_	Jookia: I have a reasonable basis in the underlying theory.
2015-12-13 01:56:57	koz_	JamesJRH: Lol, well, I dunno category theory.
2015-12-13 01:57:07	koz_	I basically go as far as FO, and even there I'm missing quite a few pieces.
2015-12-13 01:57:21	koz_	Basically it means I need to pick up a book on FMT and RTFM.
2015-12-13 01:57:24	Jookia	JamesJRH: 'do notation considered harmful' is a bit of an interesting read, though i don't use do notation much
2015-12-13 01:57:59	JamesJRH	For some reason, though, the category theory way is described as ‘the advanced way’ by many books or tutorials, including the Haskell Wikibook.
2015-12-13 01:58:25	Jookia	It's probably because everyone comes from different backgrounds
2015-12-13 01:58:33	Jookia	Maths, OO, structured programming
2015-12-13 02:01:28	JamesJRH	Jookia: It is okay to learn do-notation after learning arrows (bind and then), and it is okay to learn arrows after learning monads in terms of join, return, and fmap.
2015-12-13 02:01:37	JamesJRH	But it really should be in that order.
2015-12-13 02:02:14	Jookia	JamesJRH: yeah, its a bit of a trap in understanding
2015-12-13 02:02:41	JamesJRH	I.e., monads in terms of category theory (join, return, and fmap), then arrows (bind and then), then do-notation.
2015-12-13 02:03:06	Jookia	JamesJRH: At risk of starting a flamewar, >>= or =<< ?
2015-12-13 02:04:03	JamesJRH	If you start with do-notation because ‘Oh, it looks like imperative programming.’, then you'll never get to monads.
2015-12-13 02:04:48	JamesJRH	Well, not until you start with monads, at least. :-P
2015-12-13 02:05:18	JamesJRH	Jookia: That isn't anything to do with understanding the concepts, though.
2015-12-13 02:05:35	JamesJRH	It's just, which order do you put the notation.
2015-12-13 02:05:42	Jookia	JamesJRH: sure but it's more of a preference. i feel like >>= disrupts reading flow :P
2015-12-13 02:09:03	JamesJRH	I thought that the issue was for (.) and ($) disrupting reasing flow, or do you prefer reading right-to-left?
2015-12-13 02:09:15	JamesJRH	It's not a big deal though either way.
2015-12-13 02:09:29	JamesJRH	reading*
2015-12-13 02:09:42	Jookia	i prefer reading in one direction, not right-to-left and left-to-right-for-monads
2015-12-13 02:09:59	JamesJRH	Ah, I see. :-)
2015-12-13 02:10:05	JamesJRH	Yep, it makes semse.

2015-12-13 02:17:00	JamesJRH	Because it is more useful that ‘T’.
2015-12-13 02:17:01	Jookia	why tho
2015-12-13 02:17:09	JamesJRH	And doesn't affect ordering.
2015-12-13 02:17:29	JamesJRH	When sorting lexicographically.
2015-12-13 02:18:08	Jookia	but it's not universal
2015-12-13 02:18:29	JamesJRH	I.e., it preserves the lexicographic order = chronological order property, but with being a bit more useful.

2015-12-13 15:56:45	JamesJRH	Precendence makes the law lumpy and unpredictable, as well as somewhat rigid to change, given loopholes in new laws, and loopholes are inevitable.
2015-12-13 15:57:02	Digit	robert arthur menard.  at last, remembered his name.  any of his lectures do well to introduce and explain it.  i hold him in /similar/ high regard as i do rms and eben moglen.
2015-12-13 15:57:23	JamesJRH	And seeing as common law gives precedence a lot of weight, it is extra lumpy and rigid. :-(
2015-12-13 15:59:34	JamesJRH	By ‘lumpy’, I mean inconsistent. With precedence, imagine that a new law is sort of a holey mesh over the old law.
2015-12-13 16:00:55	JamesJRH	The gaps in the mesh are the inevitable loopholes, and the old law leaks through due to precedence and expensive lawyers.
2015-12-13 16:02:11	Digit	maybe some day we'll have a system where we just look up the akashic records n look into the soul of anyone aledged to have caused harm, n see their intent, n see what ails them to have come to such ill intent if any, n find remedy from there.  until then though... we have to navigate through a technologically changing world with blossoming facimalies of the akashic records (i.e. surveilance states, proliferation and normalisation of
2015-12-13 16:02:11	Digit	spy tech, etc), with a lumpy statutory regulatory system, and many a resource-imbalance induced usurption/corruption of our laws with further loopholes to bolster more injust resource-imbalance inequalities.
2015-12-13 16:02:54	JamesJRH	Digit: And that extra complication makes more expensive lawyers – or teams of lawyers even – far more effective, which massively favours big corporate industry.

2015-12-13 16:09:56	JamesJRH	I've been thinking and pondering over the years about a democratic ecomonic system that will allow people to decide what's good on-the-fly, during their everyday lives.
2015-12-13 16:12:16	JamesJRH	But the current status is that although I've made some interesting breakthroughs over the years, I'm still not certain that I've got a totally firm foundation, because I have an unresolved discrepancy between what I consider a close-to-ideal monetary system and what I consider a close-to-ideal democratic system.
2015-12-13 16:13:14	JamesJRH	Nevertheless, both systems are phenomenonly better than current political and economic systems.
2015-12-13 16:13:49	Digit	with the technology that may arise past suppression attempts this century... it's gonna get interesting.   like when even matter is copyable on a similar level to digital information is now.  what that does to undermine theft... and how much worse a crime it seems in context of no viable deprivation desperation excuses anymore.   ... and then when we have on-the-fly backups of even our physical bodies and our mind/soul/etc, how that
2015-12-13 16:13:49	Digit	attenuates harm.   ... and when truth becomes a conveniently scannable thing with our tricorders, what that then does to the search for truth, n how the game changes for fraud...

2015-12-13 16:23:10	JamesJRH	15:15:09 < Digit> once manufactured scarcity is but a dark mark in our history, these concerns will be more tangible.  ← Btw., although resource scarcity occurs naturally (e.g. famine), our current monetary systems have a guaranteed phantom economic scarsity. Is is a symptom of the mere mathematics of it.
2015-12-13 16:23:35	JamesJRH	There is actually more economic scarcity than there should be, which is why the current system needs completely replacing as soon as possible.

2015-12-13 16:33:01	JamesJRH	Not as in scarcity in the manufacturing industry, but rather as in intentionally making scarcity.

2015-12-13 18:03:13	SylvieLorxu	Oh, wait, crap
2015-12-13 18:03:22	Jookia	why are you using sslstrip
2015-12-13 18:03:29	SylvieLorxu	The MitM system gets the HTTPS page, then strips SSL and sends it to the victim
2015-12-13 18:03:35	SylvieLorxu	So the actual request IS https

2015-12-13 18:07:03	Jookia	Calinou: yuck
2015-12-13 18:07:04	SylvieLorxu	Because it redirects to HTTPS and then sets a HSTS policy
2015-12-13 18:07:12	SylvieLorxu	Which the browser caches
2015-12-13 18:07:27	SylvieLorxu	But a standard 301 redirect to HTTPS already works
2015-12-13 18:07:52	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: that'd just redirect you to sslstrip tho
2015-12-13 18:08:24	SylvieLorxu	Jookia: I'm running sslstrip right here. If people visited my site before, my scheme beats sslstrip
2015-12-13 18:08:33	SylvieLorxu	Because the browsers cache "Oh I need to use HTTPS here"
2015-12-13 18:08:51	SylvieLorxu	But on first-time visits, no way to stop it
2015-12-13 18:09:05	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: sounds a bit useless then? :P
2015-12-13 18:09:39	Jookia	granted that is a neat trick but it's probably better to leave it to the browser to use HTTPS all the tim
2015-12-13 18:09:54	SylvieLorxu	Well, definitely
2015-12-13 18:10:02	SylvieLorxu	But the thing is, I can't change browser settings of clients

2015-12-13 18:10:35	SylvieLorxu	JamesJRH: Did sslstrip not remove the HTTPS?

2015-12-13 18:11:35	Jookia	SylvieLorxu: what i'm saying is it's probably not worth the effort of hacking around insecure systems if they're still going to be insecure
2015-12-13 18:11:56	JamesJRH	SylvieLorxu: I only see HTTP. I'm talking about the site that you pasted on, not the paste itself.

2015-12-13 18:14:07	JamesJRH	And okay, the actual paste may be encrypted client-side, which is cool, but if the page isn't encrypted then it's a total fail.

2015-12-13 18:16:20	Jookia	pretty much
2015-12-13 18:16:24	Jookia	i'm so tired of things saying they're 'secure' when they're lying
2015-12-13 18:16:33	JamesJRH	Indeed!
2015-12-13 18:16:53	JamesJRH	I don't really trust browser security.
2015-12-13 18:16:55	Jookia	if it's proprietary, it's insecure. if it's in a browser, it's insecure. if you don't verify keys, it's not secure
2015-12-13 18:17:03	Jookia	if its automatic, it's not secure
2015-12-13 18:18:03	JamesJRH	If it's not connected to the Internet or other communications network, then it's secure. :-)
2015-12-13 18:18:08	Jookia	JamesJRH: wrong!
2015-12-13 18:18:19	JamesJRH	Well, then there's /physical/ security. :-/

2015-12-13 18:20:16	Jookia	if both ends of the encryption don't verify each other's keys out of band, it's insecure

2015-12-13 18:35:41	JamesJRH	One of my biggest questions about security is: ‘Even if you achieve reproducibility, how do you verify the compiler?’
2015-12-13 18:36:00	JamesJRH	Or rather, how do /we/ verify the compiler?
2015-12-13 18:36:06	JamesJRH	Feasibly.
2015-12-13 18:36:35	Jookia	verify as in trust or as in that its writing instructions properly
2015-12-13 18:37:53	JamesJRH	Well, a build may be reproducible, but that could just mean that the compiler is inserting bugs in all builds consistently.
2015-12-13 18:38:10	JamesJRH	It doesn't mean that it's not doing that.
2015-12-13 18:38:34	JamesJRH	It helps other parts of the issue though.
2015-12-13 18:38:35	Jookia	*shrug* use a ton of different compilers to verify each compiler
2015-12-13 18:38:48	JamesJRH	:-)
2015-12-13 18:39:07	Jookia	that seems to be how other do it
2015-12-13 18:40:46	JamesJRH	I would be interested if there could be compiler reference implementations that are just about simplicity of implementation, and has minimal performance considerations if that increases understandability.
2015-12-13 18:41:09	JamesJRH	For making it easier to security audit.
2015-12-13 18:41:38	Jookia	there probably are
2015-12-13 18:43:03	JamesJRH	Then the fast performance but complex compilers have to try to produce binaries that are bit-for-bit identical to the secure referrence one.
2015-12-13 18:43:18	JamesJRH	But that's easier said than done. :-(
2015-12-13 18:43:59	Jookia	some compilers are just nondeterministic so we'll never get bit-for-bit identical stuff
2015-12-13 18:45:37	Jookia	wget2 - coming soon

2015-12-13 18:58:43	Jookia	tane: by putting github as a legitimate option you're destroying the ability to use free software to build projects

2015-12-13 18:59:19	JamesJRH	Nice.
2015-12-13 18:59:52	JamesJRH	This is my least favourite bit of NixOS – that they use GitHub.
2015-12-13 19:00:23	Jookia	tane: and yes, i could use github since i'm privileged to be able to
2015-12-13 19:00:49	Jookia	i have the option to use nonfree software, but that doesn't mean others do

2015-12-13 19:01:16	Jookia	i feel it's hypocritical to not dogfood your freedom
2015-12-13 19:01:54	tane	that's alright
2015-12-13 19:01:59	JamesJRH	Digit: What does ‘nixos-least-fave’ mean?
2015-12-13 19:02:34	Digit	"This is my least favourite bit of NixOS – that they use GitHub." is what it mean.  :3
2015-12-13 19:02:50	Jookia	tane: for a bit more of a criticism, github's tools are vendor lock-in
2015-12-13 19:02:56	Digit	n since guixsd is closely related to nixos
2015-12-13 19:02:57	JamesJRH	Ah.
2015-12-13 19:03:08	Jookia	tane: so you can't federate github with a free hosting provider or code review
2015-12-13 19:03:19	Digit	^
2015-12-13 19:03:21	Digit	yep.
2015-12-13 19:03:37	Jookia	tane: the ideal would be 'contribute from anywhere, github, mailing list, notabug' but unfortunately there's no way to do this
2015-12-13 19:03:38	Digit	tis why i notabug.org my stuff, since i can up n gog-off somewhere else with it.
2015-12-13 19:03:38	JamesJRH	Digit: There's no reason why they have to stay using GitHub forever.
2015-12-13 19:04:04	Jookia	JamesJRH: sure there is- they can't export all the bugs + issues + project discussion
2015-12-13 19:04:05	JamesJRH	I will contribute to NixOS, but try to persuade them to not use GitHub.
2015-12-13 19:04:26	JamesJRH	Why?
2015-12-13 19:04:34	JamesJRH	Why not?*
2015-12-13 19:04:43	Jookia	JamesJRH: github doesn't let you
2015-12-13 19:04:51	JamesJRH	:-O
2015-12-13 19:05:22	Digit	my old stuff is still on github, but i plan to get everything migrated to notabug, and then also have some kind of backup plan in order, some mirror of it all elsewhere.  :)   and then also have some snapshots of the gogsware so i can rebuild after catastrophe
2015-12-13 19:05:30	Jookia	i don't think ther's any intentional free software support on github, actually- aside from git itself
2015-12-13 19:05:51	Jookia	github adds many proprietary extensions to their git service too, which is usually used to argue that people use it
2015-12-13 19:06:04	tane	well, one could provide a webscraping tool that actually scrapes all the necessary information out
2015-12-13 19:06:20	Jookia	ie i've seen the maintainer of ctags be encouraged to migrate the project to github since github has SVN access (proprietary extension)
2015-12-13 19:06:43	Jookia	tane: sure, but have they? will github allow that? how would it deal with backhaul of large projects?
2015-12-13 19:06:44	Digit	there are a lot of shiny trinkets in github that i really really like a lot.  ... this does not increase how much i like github, since there's little in the way of letting me really have thoe trinkets to play with.  it's like i can look but i cant touch.  
2015-12-13 19:07:47	Jookia	i'm also skeptical github even uses git

2015-12-13 21:34:42	SylvieLorxu	RIP francis7's internet speed
2015-12-13 21:35:00	francis7	nah
2015-12-13 21:35:05	francis7	it's fine
2015-12-13 21:36:45	francis7	bandwidth is free, and I have plenty
2015-12-13 21:37:57	francis7	it's only upload anyway
2015-12-13 21:37:58	SylvieLorxu	I wonder how the wget thing works if francis7 updates the collection
2015-12-13 21:38:11	francis7	yeah I should set up an rsync mirror instead
2015-12-13 21:38:11	SylvieLorxu	Will it redownload every time? Probably has a flag to skip existing files
2015-12-13 21:38:35	francis7	in fact I have rsync installed
2015-12-13 21:39:16	SylvieLorxu	How can we submit music, btw? :P
2015-12-13 21:39:55	francis7	well I have limited disk space here
2015-12-13 21:40:08	francis7	just host an rsync or something and I'll pull from you
2015-12-13 21:40:28	SylvieLorxu	I can't. I'm not hosting it on the company VPS and our router is too crappy

2015-12-13 21:41:54	francis7	SylvieLorxu, ^
2015-12-13 21:41:57	francis7	it works
2015-12-13 21:42:03	Jookia	tl;dr: instead of fibe to the node we get a mix of copper, HFC, 4G, satellite, fibre to the home and fire to the node
2015-12-13 21:42:03	SylvieLorxu	That was quick
2015-12-13 21:42:15	francis7	SylvieLorxu, I am quick.
2015-12-13 21:42:22	francis7	Well I already had it set up for libreboot
2015-12-13 21:42:28	Jookia	fibre to the node* instead of fibre to the home*
2015-12-13 21:42:32	SylvieLorxu	Still
2015-12-13 21:42:53	SylvieLorxu	It takes me longer to put another domain name online, lol
2015-12-13 21:42:57	francis7	SylvieLorxu, https://paste.debian.net/plainh/0a812dae
2015-12-13 21:43:12	SylvieLorxu	That's all?
2015-12-13 21:43:14	francis7	yep
2015-12-13 21:43:17	francis7	rsync is pretty easy
2015-12-13 21:43:19	SylvieLorxu	That's cool
2015-12-13 21:43:21	francis7	the mirrormirror one is for libreboot
2015-12-13 21:43:35	francis7	http://libreboot.org/rsync/
2015-12-13 21:43:35	SylvieLorxu	kl3: Ping, it has rsync now
2015-12-13 21:43:35	fpbot	“Mirroring libreboot”
2015-12-13 21:43:58	francis7	libreboot release archives have been on rsync for a while now, so adding one for the music stuff was pretty easy for me
2015-12-13 21:45:26	francis7	rsync://rsync.libreboot.org/music and rsync.libreboot.org::music should both work
2015-12-13 21:46:10	francis7	Jookia, this is "fiber to the home" in marketingspeak, but I call it VDSL, its proper name
2015-12-13 21:46:22	francis7	that's what I have here. It's basically equivalent to cable
2015-12-13 21:46:50	Jookia	francis7: any good?
2015-12-13 21:46:56	francis7	nope
2015-12-13 21:47:03	francis7	80Mbps down, 20Mbps up
2015-12-13 21:47:11	Jookia	wow that's amazing
2015-12-13 21:47:13	ic2000	who has md experience
2015-12-13 21:47:15	francis7	not really
2015-12-13 21:47:18	Jookia	francis7: you what
2015-12-13 21:47:34	francis7	I can get 1Gbps both ways *for less money per month* if I move
2015-12-13 21:47:45	francis7	(I will be)
2015-12-13 21:47:53	Jookia	francis7: 15mbps down, 5mbps up here - shared over a household of gamers
2015-12-13 21:48:11	francis7	20Mbps up here, shared over an IRC channel of music lovers :)
2015-12-13 21:48:44	Jookia	amazing compared to what i have
2015-12-13 21:48:48	francis7	at least this service is reliable
2015-12-13 21:48:54	francis7	latency and uptime is just as important as speed
2015-12-13 21:49:10	francis7	my last ISP was faster, but downtime was about 2% - unacceptable
2015-12-13 21:49:26	Jookia	that's pretty high over a year
2015-12-13 21:49:28	francis7	with this ISP (which I've now used for over a year), downtime is more like 0.02%
2015-12-13 21:49:30	Jookia	like 6 days
2015-12-13 21:49:43	francis7	and latency is like 7ms
2015-12-13 21:49:48	francis7	really low
2015-12-13 21:50:06	francis7	(7ms between me and them)
2015-12-13 21:50:13	francis7	(and about 7.5ms to google)
2015-12-13 21:50:34	francis7	old ISP.... --> 40ms or more
2015-12-13 21:50:37	Jookia	wow
2015-12-13 21:51:01	SylvieLorxu	I'm pretty sure the downtime of this ISP has been a lot more than 2% lol
2015-12-13 21:51:34	Jookia	i think my google ping is 200ms
2015-12-13 21:51:40	Jookia	maybe 150 maximum
2015-12-13 21:51:48	francis7	SylvieLorxu, https://www.xs4all.nl/
2015-12-13 21:51:59	francis7	have you used them before? a lot of people told me they were good
2015-12-13 21:52:09	SylvieLorxu	xs4all seems expensive, but they seem the most ethical choice
2015-12-13 21:52:29	francis7	chello seems to have been eaten by ziggo lately

2015-12-13 21:56:18	francis7	SylvieLorxu, xs4all is one of the ISPs that got TPB unblocked in NL
2015-12-13 21:56:35	francis7	they're still fighting it even now (to prevent being court ordered again)

2015-12-13 21:57:01	fpbot	“BREIN | XS4ALL Weblog”
2015-12-13 21:57:56	francis7	also they provide static IPs and IPv6, and ftth and so on. they are AAISP, but in dutch
2015-12-13 21:58:38	francis7	(aaisp is what I use, because I can't use xs4all in the UK. http://aa.net.uk/)
2015-12-13 21:59:02	SylvieLorxu	And on the other side of the spectrum is Ziggo
2015-12-13 21:59:14	SylvieLorxu	Who still do not even support TLS on email
2015-12-13 21:59:20	SylvieLorxu	I'm not even kidding
2015-12-13 21:59:33	francis7	your ISP is owned by ziggo now
2015-12-13 21:59:36	SylvieLorxu	Yes
2015-12-13 21:59:43	SylvieLorxu	I'm hoping Ziggo may make it a bit better
2015-12-13 21:59:47	SylvieLorxu	But UPC was a mess, always
2015-12-13 22:00:04	SylvieLorxu	The first changes Ziggo made caused a lot of bugs with UPC software such as the TV stuff, though
2015-12-13 22:00:15	SylvieLorxu	Where planned recordings started to record the wrong channel
2015-12-13 22:00:17	SylvieLorxu	Stuff like that
2015-12-13 22:00:29	SylvieLorxu	But that just means that Ziggo probably inherited a really shitty codebase
2015-12-13 22:00:34	SylvieLorxu	And that's not really their fault so much
2015-12-13 22:00:36	SylvieLorxu	But we'll see...
2015-12-13 22:04:20	francis7	Well
2015-12-13 22:05:01	francis7	AAISP is really crap
2015-12-13 22:05:16	francis7	it's the best ISP in the UK, but it's still crap
2015-12-13 22:05:32	francis7	they charge a lot
2015-12-13 22:06:05	francis7	for literally 1/3 the price, I could get 500Mbps both ways in certain areas of NL (with xs4all)
2015-12-13 22:06:35	francis7	(ftth, also the give you a little dongle thingy for 4g backup)
2015-12-13 22:07:09	francis7	(1/3 of the price for unmetered bandwidth, I mean)
2015-12-13 22:07:58	francis7	I could get a cheaper service in the UK, and get a lower speed, higher ping, less uptime and no IPv6
2015-12-13 22:08:02	francis7	and no IRC tech support
2015-12-13 22:08:14	francis7	--> that's one thing I haven't found in dutch ISPs yet :)

2015-12-13 22:11:42	Jookia	i should move to germany

2015-12-13 22:23:38	francis7	that's a lot of data
2015-12-13 22:24:06	francis7	that means I've uploaded 359GiB since last reboot
2015-12-13 22:24:24	francis7	that's on a 59 day uptime
2015-12-13 22:24:44	francis7	so, 180GiB per month
2015-12-13 22:25:25	Jookia	nice
2015-12-13 22:25:27	francis7	just checked control pages on ISP login
2015-12-13 22:25:38	francis7	they say I've uploaded 326GiB this month

2015-12-13 22:26:14	 *	francis7 uploads more than he downloads, on a regular basis
2015-12-13 22:27:13	francis7	In January 2015 I uploaded 1.26TiB, downloaded 524GiB

2015-12-14 19:41:19	fpbot	"Hello. Sorry for the Wekan board trouble. It looks like my instance is doing great now. The CPU issue was a result of wekan's init script `restart` command starting a new instance without stopping the old one (this is a bug of course, i will fix it or use pkill -9 from now on) so i had many instances running and together they created load."

2015-12-14 19:43:45	vaeringjar	fr33domlover, no problem about wekan. I'm looking into changing hosts and also asking my host provider if they will make some changes in order to allow for sandstorm and thus wekan. 
2015-12-14 19:46:31	Jookia	It's kinda nice being on a computer that doesn't make you feel terrible
