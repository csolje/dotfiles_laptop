2015-11-08 21:08:09	msjche_	hey Psyq,  if you're talking about the keybinds in my .Xresources then it's "alt" as in "alt + u" starts the url-select ruby keybinds
2015-11-08 21:08:31	msjche_	sorry, meant to say perl keybinds :)
2015-11-08 21:09:59	Psyq	okie did you change it lately?
2015-11-08 21:11:56	msjche_	nope, i've been using the same URxvt.keysum.M-... keybinds for a while so they should work
2015-11-08 21:12:05	msjche_	which distro are you running?
2015-11-08 21:12:17	Psyq	right now it is opensuse
2015-11-08 21:12:25	Psyq	but I am going to Arch soon
2015-11-08 21:12:49	msjche_	mmmm... in arch you need to make sure you have installed urxvt-perls to get these to work
2015-11-08 21:14:50	Psyq	okie I will http://pastebin.com/f0DmKNfk <-- that is the .Xresources that I use
2015-11-08 21:15:40	Psyq	line 5 and 8 doesn't it define the meta to be ESC?
2015-11-08 21:22:47	msjche_	i'm acutally not sure.  i've always had that in there without thinking about it.  is it the copy/paste function you're looking for?
2015-11-08 21:24:51	Psyq	no more what the line 5 stands for meta8
2015-11-08 21:25:37	Psyq	I have never really understood what the meta8 stood for
2015-11-08 21:30:48	msjche_	ya i don't know either ???
2015-11-08 21:31:36	Psyq	that is okie hehe thank you for your help :)
