2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:07:14] how to kill a process with a command?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Nixola	[14:07:39] mike-zal: "killall -9 process-name" or "kill -9 process-id"
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:07:44] I cannot start gparted now and it has some process running that cannot be ended
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:07:51] thanks
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Nixola	[14:07:51] mike-zal: wait
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Nixola	[14:07:54] wait!
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:07:55] yes?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Nixola	[14:08:04] that's a quite... harsh way to do that
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Nixola	[14:08:26] you should only use kill/killall -9 when literally the only other option is rebooting, if there can be serious consequences
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:08:29] normal way doesn't cut it so the hard way seems  to be good way :P
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Nixola	[14:08:42] what's the running process that you have to terminate?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:08:59] gparted-pkexec
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:09:07] I can't open gparted now
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:09:29] I hope I will if I kill this hanging bastard ;)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Nixola	[14:10:08] if that hanging bastard is doing some serious stuff you might break your whole setup ^^
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Nixola	[14:10:11] so be careful
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Nixola	[14:10:30] I don't know what gparted-pkexec does exactly, so I can't tel you more
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:10:37] nope, just wanted to open it. was opening and closing it a dozens times. it's not doing anything right now
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:11:11] yeah, dead motherfucker :D, sorry for language ;)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Nixola	[14:11:13] ok
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Nixola	[14:11:18] good for you then
2016-01-16 15:16:47	manjaro-jwm	[14:12:34] hi, I am on Manjaro JWM, I have installed some app like Firefox, GIMP bot they are nowhere on right mouse button menu. I added Firefox manually but is there a way to do it automatically? All of the installed ones? 
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:12:42] shit, didn't work, gparted is still not running after giving the pass. reboot then.

2016-01-16 15:16:47	manjaro-web|953	[14:22:04] hi
2016-01-16 15:16:47	HrnekBezucha	[14:22:40] I have a bit of an issue with installation
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:23:22] ringo32: my usb seemes to be fixed. no error messages when opening gparted. and weird thing is, it happend during doing things I tried to do over a dozens times. now it seemed to work finnally
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:23:36] now I'm trying to do it the way you posted
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:24:20] ok
2016-01-16 15:16:47	superbia	[14:24:29] ringo32: o
2016-01-16 15:16:47	superbia	[14:24:41] ringo32: my xfce panel decided it wont work again
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:28:04] why usb format won't delete old files?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	superbia	[14:28:30] ?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:28:41] how to open thinar in admin mode superbia?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	superbia	[14:28:42] because "delete" is fictional word
2016-01-16 15:16:47	superbia	[14:28:54] mike-zal: open terminal and hit "sudo thunar"
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:29:05] I formated usb in gparted and after mounting I still see old folders..
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:29:19] ah, right, forgot about that..
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:29:28] superbia  remove session :)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	superbia	[14:29:34] ringo32: how
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:30:29] rm ~/.cache/sessions/*
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:32:16] weird, thunar in admin mode has a trouble to do anything. caan't copy and paste files, can't drag them...
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:33:32] ok, I can't copy anything to my usb, it says read only, why?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Lowl3v3l	[14:33:47] mike-zal, i suppose it would've been surprising if it did just do those things, it is not only thuna running in the background ;)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	superbia	[14:34:17] ringo32: ty. btw why does that happen
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Lowl3v3l	[14:34:33] mike-zal, if it is a problem with rights just use chmod.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:34:52] depend what happened
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:35:20] yeah, but I'm not too familiar with chmod. usually I use gui like krusader to do that stuff. ah, why wouldn't I install it here too?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	superbia	[14:35:31] ringo32: it appears to be working again
2016-01-16 15:16:47	superbia	[14:35:48] just as i wanted to purge the manjaro out my laptop for good
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:36:55] why ?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:36:56] uh, instaalling krusader requires of removing lot of packages :/. what to do?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:36:57] :)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:37:21] all packages to remove are libqt, weird
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:37:28] maybe they're outdated
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:37:53] i dont know
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:38:00] they're all libqt4
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:38:14] is there libqt5 now? I guess it should be
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:40:43] krusader ?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:40:56] bit different and more informative output i terminal so I install it from there
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:41:03] yeah, kde app
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:41:30] krusader in unstable does not show libqt
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:41:50] it installs with a admin krusader so you can do all that stuff that you normally can't. it's easy to work with root and change chmod with it
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:42:01] kdebase but ..
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:42:34] it worked well for me since always. I need it as a replacement for total commander. tried other similar apps, they sucked. krusader is the best
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:43:27] I sometimes try to do things through termina but it takes me ages. it's quicker for me to use gui
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:45:13] you on kde5 ?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:46:42] at home yes, now I'm on mint xfce
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:48:27] ah outdated :p
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:48:40] mint XFCE follows lts model
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:48:43] yeah, that's mint..
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:48:56] had to do on ubuntu repos
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:49:11] weird, I formated in gparted my usb to ntfs and system still sees it as fat32
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:49:17] they say about 6 month release
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[14:49:21] but that isnt
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:50:06] gparted failed me so many times, it seems I can't trust it now :(
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Vion	[14:51:13] mike-zal: I have never been failed by gparted. Have you tried the livecd of it?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:51:55] no, but I used it on various distros and various computers and often it doesn't work as suppose to. mainly the things it should do are not done.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:52:50] gnome disk utility came trough. it formated usb to ntfs after gparted couldn't many times
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:54:24] now I can copy files on usb. it's like all programs from gudiance sites weren't working as intented and yet when I use those I like, it works...
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[14:55:50] maybe I spoke too soon... there seems to be a problem of copying some files from iso...
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[15:00:36] shit, it's been hours and there is always some problem. now my external hdd seems to be empty after mounting. the same when I mount iso from hdd
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal	[15:00:48] brb, reloggin
2016-01-16 15:16:47	therue	[15:03:15] hi guys !
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal2	[15:13:02] ringo32: I give up. somehow win iso became empty after mount, as if there was no content. the same happens with my external drive where I had copy of this iso. so at the moment I have no files to copy on usb, no access to PC since I used my last usb with live linux at work, reboot is not helping. I have no idea what went wrong. it was all good, was
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal2	[15:13:02]  copying files and then it stopped in the middle, I wasn't doing anything. after that moment the files are gone.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	mike-zal2	[15:14:18] going home, have plans for the evening. fuck windows and mint xfce at the moment ;P
2016-01-16 15:16:47	ringo32	[15:14:41] is it not you must make the usb drive clean fat32 before you burn ?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Vlado9A3CY	[15:15:57] It's pretty stupid that any time I start some video in Kodi player, audio volume for Kodi is set to zero percent and I have to gain it up ...
2016-01-16 15:16:47	Vlado9A3CY	[15:16:43] as well as starting youtube video in web browser with audio balance set to right channel, so I have to set it to middle

2016-01-16 15:41:12	therue	which arch based distro is best ? :) for getting ready for arch
2016-01-16 15:41:26	Lowl3v3l	Arch
2016-01-16 15:41:36	therue	i actually do have arch installed on my laptop, but i kinda want to use an easier arch based distro first
2016-01-16 15:42:16	therue	'cuz eventhough i installed arch, it took a while to figure everything out, then i gotta set up the tiling window i want, get familiar learning linux... with arch for a first time linux user
2016-01-16 15:42:24	therue	ust too much to learn all at once
2016-01-16 15:42:32	therue	kinda wanna find a pre-config arch based system
2016-01-16 15:42:45	therue	use it, learn how to use the linux system for everyday usage
2016-01-16 15:42:51	therue	first
2016-01-16 15:43:05	Lowl3v3l	why an arch then if it's about general linux usage?
2016-01-16 15:43:07	therue	then in the future get back to arch, and learn the set up 
2016-01-16 15:43:14	Lowl3v3l	my tipp to learn configuring arch : vm :)
2016-01-16 15:44:06	therue	because it's very clean and you're in full control since you are the one that dictates what's in it right from the start

2016-01-16 15:44:47	Lowl3v3l	therue, it's not like other distros dont do this ;) but get ana arch-vm first, train with it and someday install it.
2016-01-16 15:45:04	therue	with arch, there's learning how to use linux, and then there's learning arch system
2016-01-16 15:45:08	CinnamonRickRoll	manjaro cinnamon is nice
2016-01-16 15:45:22	Lowl3v3l	therue, it's like this with every distro.
2016-01-16 15:45:25	therue	doing both at the same time while also having to do web development, i much prefer to just be able to use linux right off the bat, learn how to use linux
2016-01-16 15:45:46	therue	have that down first.... then going back to arch will just require me learning tthe arch system and not linux in itself 
2016-01-16 15:46:05	therue	Lowl3v3l,  i already got it installed by myself on laptop

2016-01-16 16:35:21	manots	i'm basically saying that "God's not dead" made pureflix look  like buffoons (i respect christianity tho)
2016-01-16 16:36:01	CountryfiedLinux	I love the Pureflix movies.
2016-01-16 16:36:14	CountryfiedLinux	I have a pureflix.com account actually and thinking about canceling Netflix.

2016-01-16 16:37:03	ben_chile	corevelay: downgrade is a terminal program, once it's installed you can  install older versions
2016-01-16 16:37:52	Bagga	CountryfiedLinux: so if I get Pureflix I won't be corrupted by the devil?
2016-01-16 16:37:53	+thenewone	manots: lol
2016-01-16 16:38:09	+thenewone	manots: why exactly ?
2016-01-16 16:38:11	+thenewone	me 
2016-01-16 16:38:42	manots	there was a scene where a muslim woman tried to convert to chistianity and was beaten by her family for it
2016-01-16 16:38:45	corevelay	ben_chile Alright, but I can't install the newer version in the first place
2016-01-16 16:38:46	CountryfiedLinux	It's a movie stream site Bagga kinda like Netflix but family friendly and Christian movies.

2016-01-16 16:40:21	manots	the point is that the movie said that muslims were women beaters you are a muslim 
2016-01-16 16:40:23	+thenewone	it's about personne how they are reacting 
2016-01-16 16:40:24	CountryfiedLinux	The scene you're referring to is accurate to reality in some cases manots but I don't think the intent was to demonize an entire group.
