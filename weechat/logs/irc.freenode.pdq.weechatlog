2015-12-29 23:15:25	pdq	i use tor browser
2015-12-29 23:16:00	pdq	if i want to buiy something from amazon or use steam website or bank for example i use firefox
2015-12-29 23:16:05	pdq	everything else is tor browser
2015-12-29 23:16:42	psyq	okie that sounds good
2015-12-29 23:27:48	psyq	so you just download the tor browser
2015-12-29 23:37:40	pdq	in arch i use tor-broswer-en package
2015-12-29 23:37:59	pdq	the linux version of tor-browser is also just about same thing
2015-12-29 23:38:07	pdq	arch*
2015-12-29 23:38:55	pdq	whenever close tor browser it deletes all history and cookies so need to login to sites every time
2015-12-29 23:39:23	pdq	but you can import or create bookmarks like normal firefox bookmarking sites then export this
2015-12-29 23:39:36	pdq	then everytime tor browser updates it deletes everything and need to reimport bookmarks
2015-12-29 23:39:45	pdq	other than that is great
2015-12-29 23:40:28	pdq	it does have a built ion adblocker but js and other plugins are disabled with noscript so if want to enable js you do on site per site basis
2015-12-29 23:40:36	pdq	doesn't have*
2015-12-29 23:40:38	pdq	lol
2015-12-29 23:41:05	pdq	most ads are js/flash so they get blocked or not show unless you allow them
2015-12-29 23:44:36	psyq	that is true
