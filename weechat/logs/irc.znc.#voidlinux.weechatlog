2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[10:39:22] Hi guys, is there any possibility to run suspend to RAM (zzz) on normal PC? I have acpid running after start, but when I type zzz to commandline it shows me "zzz: suspend not supported" in MAN there is info that my HW or kernel doesn't support the suspend.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[10:40:09] Hello lads :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[10:42:11] How's everyone? :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	nkparadox	[10:44:02] Goodmorning  people. I can't get ranger to show pictures in rxvt-unicode. I have installed w3m and enabled preview_image in rc.conf. Anyone know whats going on?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[10:47:07] What's ranger? :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	chris2	[10:47:34] nkparadox: install w3m-img
2016-01-16 15:16:48	nkparadox	[10:48:06] chris2: you are a god thanks!
2016-01-16 15:16:48	chris2	[10:50:03] nah, just a maintainer
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[11:13:15] mender27, ranger is cool file manager to console http://ranger.nongnu.org/
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[11:33:08] tom-i: this thing is absolutely cool!
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[11:35:22] my favorite is perhaps the xfe suit.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[11:36:00] also old-sql, but graphical
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[11:40:47] Wow, ranger seems even better than Midnight Commander :).
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[11:41:14] Less visual clutter :).
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[11:56:22] mender27, yy I love it too :P
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[11:56:59] mender27, it has tabs, swithing in last possition as in Vi
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[11:57:10] more keybingings like in Vi
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[11:57:15] tom-i: sounds wonderful
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[11:57:58] you can use extract/pack files with external tool (apack), you can see images in ranger too.. but there are not so nice :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[11:58:04] I like the fact that it handles thumbnails. Makes me want to drop GUI altogether.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[11:58:27] I'm using it in the work too and I have to access to different servers (Linux, Windows)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[11:58:37] mender27, :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[11:58:55] Honestly, the only useful thing about normal DEs is the switching between tasks and window-sizing
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[11:59:02] that mounting think I miss in Ranger..
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[11:59:42] it doesn't support to un/mount network places like fish:// protocol in Krusader
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[12:00:04] so I had to mount all servers I wanted to manage to my /mnt
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:02:03] ugly solution, I admit
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:02:11] What about mc?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[12:03:57] mender27, I don't use it most of the time.. I used to use more Krusader in KDE.. it was my primary file manager. It has many features you want and even more. Like I said about fishl:// protocol and so on.. but .. it's not so handy, if you want to use just keybord..
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[12:04:18] I had to move my hand from keyboard, to mouse..
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[12:04:31] so I tried Vifm 1st time..
2016-01-16 15:16:48	tom-i	[12:06:14] but it didn't engage me.. it's more like MC maybe.. then I found ranger.. and I like it from 1st time I saw it :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:15:42] I think that's nice :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:16:40] The need for switching between mouse and keyboard kills me on Windows
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:17:05] I still need to use Windows at work and doing stuff in Excel is a major pain
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:17:44] Thankfully I can write stuff in Emacs :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:18:23] Last time I wrote a project draft for my boss, he said it was super organized ;D. All I did was use a lot of # signs to underline titles
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:25:57] I haven't tried KDE. I'm constantly afraid it's super heavy :(.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:27:20] Does anyone use gpm and knows how to add it as a service to runit? :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	skrzyp	[12:28:31] ln
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:34:49] Hmmm...I find it quite interesting that so many Linux distributions package runit, yet not so many use it as default
2016-01-16 15:16:48	devster31	[12:45:33] mender27: why? runit isn't perfect, it happened to me that I messed up a run script and it kept outputting to stdout and I was totally unable to use anything until I pulled the plug and restarted
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:47:00] devster31: I'm not saying it's perfect. However, it's much better than systemd :).
2016-01-16 15:16:48	devster31	[12:48:47] the above never happened to me on systemd, it fails, systemd flags it as failed, end of story, I might be alone but I'm fine with systemd on a daily pc
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:50:08] it happened to me several times that systemd refused to boot the system upon errors in /etc/fstab. Other inits simply dropped some processes, but still booted so that I could fix the issues :).
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:51:21] I often misconfigure my cdrom in /etc/fstab and it's being auto-mounted on boot.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:51:57] I guess boh are user-related problems :).
2016-01-16 15:16:48	devster31	[12:53:26] true, my issue is only that systemd is not suitable for smaller systems, on a raspberrypi raspbian uses systemd and it's awful
2016-01-16 15:16:48	devster31	[12:55:18] one question, does xbps flag you when a restart is needed? do I have any way to guess/assume when it is?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	devster31	[12:55:33] besides kernel updates
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:56:07] I only noticed that xbps throws an error when the repos are not properly synced - some transaction error
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[12:58:52] skrzyp: I found some weirdnesses with runit. Some processes are located in /var/service and then symlinked to /etc/sv, per original runit design and some actually exist in /etc/sv. Is this normal?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	devster31	[13:02:17] my /var/service is a symlink to /run/runit/runsvdir/current which is a symlink to /run/runit/runsvdir/default my /etc/sv is like a repo for services, most of them unused
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[13:02:55] https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Runit
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[13:03:25] I think the original services should reside in /var/service
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[13:04:19] I tried checking the status of some services using 'sv s <service>"
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[13:04:56] The ones that exist in /var/service and are symlinked to /etc/sv can be checked, but the ones that original exist in /etc/sv cannot
2016-01-16 15:16:48	devster31	[13:05:20] I think that's supposed to happen, I symlink from /etc/sv to /var/services to enable them, as per https://wiki.voidlinux.eu/Runit , I just followed the instructions
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[13:05:58] My symlinks are the other way round :(.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[13:07:34] Ah, no, my bad. The symlink arrow points the other way round. Now it's ok.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mender27	[13:34:20] I think the per-user X session through runit is a useful thing to have :).
2016-01-16 15:16:48	flrn	[14:01:18] sorry, connection broke, in case anyone answered
