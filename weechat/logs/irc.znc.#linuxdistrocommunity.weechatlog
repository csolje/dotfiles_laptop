2016-01-16 15:16:47	+shymega	[14:35:22] still, the license i'm looking at is normally 43 quid
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+shymega	[14:35:26] and now it's 19.49 quid
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+shymega	[14:35:37] so i guess that's a better deal than usual
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+Acou_Bass	[14:35:52] reactOS need to up their game so people like you dont need to give MS money
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+shymega	[14:36:11] indeed
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+shymega	[14:36:30] pirating is a dodgy option for my situtation, as i live w/ family
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+shymega	[14:36:33] and use their internet
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+shymega	[14:53:13] i haven't heard much from reactos lately 
2016-01-16 15:16:47	+shymega	[14:53:27] dunno if it still looks like win2k, it resembled it anyway, when i last used it

2016-01-16 16:58:03	+Acou_Bass	i wonder how well xfce would work with openbox WM underneath
2016-01-16 16:58:50	+shymega	Acou_Bass: that took a quicker time to stroke your beard than usual

2016-01-16 17:02:06	+Acou_Bass	yeah see, i like xfce a fair bit and i dont mind mate (havent used it enough to really decide), but i prefer to use openbox for better multi-monitor support
2016-01-16 17:02:08	+Acou_Bass	so i figured
2016-01-16 17:02:11	+Acou_Bass	why not combine the 2
