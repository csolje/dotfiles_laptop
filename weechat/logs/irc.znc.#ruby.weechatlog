2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[11:48:07] the factoids are even live
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[11:48:09] What is the deal with ruby[bot] anyway?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[11:48:21] it's the new implementation of ruboto
2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[11:49:05] cinch had issues with getting the account of all registered users, which is a requirement for some of the things I want to do.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[11:49:14] s/had/has/
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[11:49:36] Is the implementation that bot made available on some git repo?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[11:49:49] f.ex. a couple of commands are now no longer available to people who aren't registered
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[11:50:11] Was ruboto abused?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[11:50:18] sadly not yet, no. I took some shortcuts when reviving butler. but I'll make the framework available again.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[11:50:24] yes
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[13:09:27] apeiros: I think it makes sense to include lex/sexp too.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[13:09:46] Not sure if that is pushing it though.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[13:11:12] norc: can you make the required amendments? https://gist.github.com/apeiros/8faff2aded4e9fa1d4d0
2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[13:11:27] I can add them to the testbot and you can test immediately in #ruboto_test
2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[13:11:51] I think you'd have to add another :format: entry in the .yaml
2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[13:12:03] and add the code there
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[13:12:07] Let me take a look.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[13:25:43] Hello everyone
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[13:25:56] Hello dbugger
2016-01-16 15:16:47	apeiros	[13:28:28] d, the bugger?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[13:47:53] I was wondering if someone could give me a hand. I was following this dead easy tutorial (http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/#introduction) to make my own gem, but when I do "gem push ..." I get this error: "ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Psych::SyntaxError)    (<unknown>): mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 9 column 26"
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[13:48:01] Can someone tell me what Im doing wrong?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	shevy	[13:48:29] dbugger sounds like an error in some yaml file
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[13:50:41] The only YML file I have is the gemspec. This is it: http://laravel.io/bin/RExke
2016-01-16 15:16:47	shevy	[13:52:11] that is ruby code
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[13:53:36] mmm, true
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[13:53:40] I have no YML file
2016-01-16 15:16:47	shevy	[13:54:03] but something invokes psych
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[13:55:14] The code is that one on the page...
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[13:55:18] there is a simple "puts"
2016-01-16 15:16:47	shevy	[13:56:08] no I do not believe you
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[14:01:30] dbugger: Take your actual code and the full stacktrace from the error message, and paste it to gisthub please.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[14:02:45] norc, That is the only output I got. how do I get a full stacktrace?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[14:03:13] dbugger: Oh wait a second.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[14:03:26] That, and the actual code (http://laravel.io/bin/Yyx2V) is the only code I got
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[14:03:37] dbugger: My first instinct is that the https://rubygems.org/api/v1/api_key.yaml that you tried to get is somehow borked.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[14:04:08] So look at your credentials file
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[14:04:37] you mean that yaml file?
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[14:04:43] Yes.
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[14:05:25] Oh!
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[14:05:32] Its a "not found" page o.O
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[14:05:35] :-)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[14:06:07] So "https://rubygems.org/api/v1/api_key.yml" is not the right URL? It is the one in that tutorial...
2016-01-16 15:16:47	norc	[14:06:29] I cannot help you any further, perhaps someone else here knows more. :)
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[14:07:01] aha!
2016-01-16 15:16:47	dbugger	[14:07:07] it is not "https://rubygems.org/api/v1/api_key.yml", it is "https://rubygems.org/api/v1/api_key.yaml"
2016-01-16 15:16:48	dbugger	[14:07:20] silly error. probably a typewriting error in the article
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:07:33] Glad you figured it out. :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	dbugger	[14:08:37] It was pure luck :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:09:05] dbugger: The tutorial states https://rubygems.org/api/v1/api_key.yaml though..
2016-01-16 15:16:48	dbugger	[14:09:52] In that case it was ME who made the error :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:10:22] dbugger: Im willing to bet that there are RSpec tests verifying that the code snippets work even.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:10:39] (The ones on the page)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	dbugger	[14:10:43] Really? Wow that is something else :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	dbugger	[14:11:05] I have seen so many more .yml files, than .yaml files, that I get confused with them often
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:11:11] I would certainly try spec such things on a large popular website
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:11:19] To ensure my users don't get non-functional snippets.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	dbugger	[14:12:32] I didnt even though such thing existed. i thought it was plain text inside a <code> and that what it :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:13:03] dbugger: Read carefully, this is just an assumption.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:13:12] But it is certainly possible to do it.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:13:28] dbugger: If you dont know about automated tests, it probably would be a good idea to look into them.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:13:32] Especially when you start writing gems.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:14:12] Minitest / RSpec (whichever you use) improve code reliability and usually even speed up development.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	dbugger	[14:18:32] norc, I know about them, but I didnt thought about doing them on "posted content" on the website. Just on the website itself :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:19:27] dbugger: Most websites are not static, they are usually built on MVC stacks (such as Ruby on Rails). So content like snippets can easily be wrapped and tested.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:24:35] dbugger: But sure, even on "posted" content on a running website this could be doable.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:24:55] (I was thinking rather along the way of such guides being hard wired into the code)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	dbugger	[14:26:36] Of course, everything is doable :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	dbugger	[14:26:43] I just never thought anyone out there was doing it :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:28:37] dbugger, when I go around to discover new libraries, I will not use them if even the basic install instructions contain errors.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[14:28:57] But that is just me,
2016-01-16 15:16:48	shevy	[14:32:03] norc sounds reasonable
2016-01-16 15:16:48	lucasb	[14:34:06] irclog.whitequark.org is down?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	apeiros	[14:34:23] seems like
2016-01-16 15:16:48	apeiros	[14:34:40] more reason to get up to speed with ruby-community.com/irc/log
2016-01-16 15:16:48	dbugger	[14:35:42] What is that?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	apeiros	[14:36:05] ruby-community.com is this channel's official companion website.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	apeiros	[14:36:44] development of it is public and coordinated in #ruby-community
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bvbrandon	[15:05:58] how does one replace text in backets with a valie?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Papierkorb	[15:06:32] bvbrandon: What do you mean?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bvbrandon	[15:08:41] lol sorry for the typos. I have this string. “I {want to} go to the park” and I have a hash with a value key “want to” => “never did” and I am trying to replace the want to in the string, with the never did from the hash
2016-01-16 15:16:48	lucasb	[15:09:59] str.gsub(/{(.*)}/, a_hash)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	lucasb	[15:10:36] maybe. I didn't test.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	lucasb	[15:11:47] use a non-greedy quantifier: /{(.+?)}/
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Papierkorb	[15:12:45] >> the_hash = { 'foo' => 'bar' }; "This {foo} works".gsub(/\{(.*)\}/){ the_hash[$1] }
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@ruby[bot]	[15:12:46] Papierkorb: # => "This bar works" (https://eval.in/503034)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Papierkorb	[15:12:49] bvbrandon: ^
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Papierkorb	[15:13:01] lucasb: {} in regex have special meaning, you need to escape them
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Papierkorb	[15:13:28] >> "This {foo} is much better".gsub(/\{(.*)\}/, { '{foo}' => 'bar' })
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Papierkorb	[15:13:30] bvbrandon:
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@ruby[bot]	[15:13:30] Papierkorb: # => "This bar is much better" (https://eval.in/503035)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bvbrandon	[15:13:44] thank you!
2016-01-16 15:16:48	nickjj_	[15:13:46] bvbrandon, it's worth mentioning that if you plan to do this a lot it might be worth looking into a templating language
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Papierkorb	[15:13:57] Oh, sorry, now you'd have to add the {} to the hash ..
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[15:14:49] bvbrandon, ruby comes with erb out of the box in case you are interested in nickjj_'s suggestion.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	lucasb	[15:14:57] Papierkorb: no need to escape {} if they are not in a quantifier position
2016-01-16 15:16:48	lucasb	[15:15:31] >> 'a{ }b'.sub(/{.*}/, 'x')
2016-01-16 15:16:48	norc	[15:15:33] bvbrandon, In all likelihood it will solve your problem more easily.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	@ruby[bot]	[15:15:33] lucasb: # => "axb" (https://eval.in/503036)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jhass	[15:16:33] or if there's influence on the source format, String#%/Kernel#sprintf can do it too

2016-01-16 15:26:54	apeiros	hm?
2016-01-16 15:27:01	apeiros	that was a genuine question
2016-01-16 15:27:04	lucasb	apeiros: but did you saw my eval? it was 'a{ }b' and it didn't matter
2016-01-16 15:27:14	apeiros	yes, I've seen it
2016-01-16 15:27:36	apeiros	ah, I mean any position in the regex, not the string
2016-01-16 15:27:50	apeiros	that it doesn't matter in the string is obvious :)
2016-01-16 15:28:07	lucasb	ah, sorry, my misundertand. let me test something then :)
2016-01-16 15:29:04	bvbrandon	papierkorb: that didn’t solve all of my test cases :/
2016-01-16 15:29:05	bvbrandon	https://eval.in/503041
2016-01-16 15:29:12	bvbrandon	it’s very close!
2016-01-16 15:29:21	apeiros	I just can't come up with any other situation than at the start of a regex where {} wouldn't be treated as a quantifier. iirc even after a quantifier it's one. i.e. iirc (expr){a,b}{c,d} is treated as ((expr){a,b}){c,d}
2016-01-16 15:29:34	apeiros	well, (?:) instead of ()
2016-01-16 15:29:43	apeiros	maybe I'm wrong. I didn't try :D
2016-01-16 15:30:28	apeiros	yepp, works that way
2016-01-16 15:30:50	apeiros	>> ["aaaaaaaaaa"[/a{1,2}{2,4}/], "aaa"[/a{1,2}{2,4}/]]

2016-01-16 15:31:11	norc	apeiros, okay just started this. What is your preferred method of escaping the input string? Im thinking of simply using %%q`%s` in the format string, since Im not sure whether there is a trivial way to properly escape any input string.

2016-01-16 17:54:34	myntcake	[17:51:21] i just started running an aws ec2 machine and installed ruby on rails. my question is, do i need apache installed too?
2016-01-16 17:54:34	myntcake	[17:51:38] i can't seem to see the rails page on ip_address:3000
2016-01-16 17:54:34	jhass	[17:52:05] you want a reverse proxy if you want to use port 80, yes. Apache and Nginx are common choices
2016-01-16 17:54:34	myntcake	[17:53:39] jhass: so i still need to install apache even if i have rails server, right?

2016-01-16 18:11:01	dbugger	apeiros, I mean, I see nowhere being ":test" written... << "test" is the name of a folder, not the symbol. So does TestTask build always a task called :test? or does it build always a task with the same symbol as the folder name?
