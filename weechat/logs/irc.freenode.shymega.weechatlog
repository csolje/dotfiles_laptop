2015-11-28 21:29:48	shymega	Fedora at the moment on my mancubus, desktop, and then tomorrow I'm getting Fedora 23 on my revenant, laptop
2015-11-28 21:45:04	psyq	so you are a fedora/redhat guy?
2015-11-28 21:53:03	shymega	I've used a lot over the years to be frank
2015-11-28 21:53:16	psyq	sweet
2015-11-28 21:53:35	shymega	Arch, Gentoo, Knoppix, Debian, RHEL, Void, CentOS, Ubuntu (704-910)
2015-11-28 21:54:21	shymega	there's probably more, but this version of Fedora is definitely my favourite, dnf is more efficent than yum for sure, i'm not waiting for ages now :D
2015-11-28 21:54:53	shymega	oh yeah, and guixsd for a brief period but i wouldn't endorse it right now, it's heavily under development and very much in alpha xD
2015-11-28 21:58:06	psyq	guixsd?
2015-11-28 21:58:08	psyq	what is that
2015-11-28 21:58:40	shymega	https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/
2016-01-10 21:21:36	shymega	err, i've been using it for a bit, I come from a Golang background, so still getting used to things like Error classess, etc. How could/can I help?
2016-01-10 21:23:52	psyq	I have two lists where I should take the amount and the prices and get the total of it I am just a bit in the wind of how I should do it
2016-01-10 21:23:52	ℹ	[shymega] is away: sleep
2016-01-10 21:24:19	shymega	OK... could you put your code so far on a paste?
2016-01-10 21:24:23	shymega	If that's possible
2016-01-10 21:24:44	psyq	sure

2016-01-10 21:31:20	shymega	What version of Python were you doing this in? There isn't a shebang or other identifier to tell me. Sorry
2016-01-10 21:34:44	psyq	I think py2
2016-01-10 21:35:03	shymega	oh right, haha, i've been working on in py3, i'll check as well
2016-01-10 21:35:19	shymega	yeah, still works in py2 \o/
