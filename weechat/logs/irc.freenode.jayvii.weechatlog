2015-11-29 01:29:59	JayVii	psyq: no wpa_supplicant :P
2015-11-29 01:30:10	JayVii	there is a tray icon for it, even :O
2015-11-29 01:30:27	JayVii	on a desktop-machine, where i have LAN, i wouldn't use anything
2015-11-29 01:30:30	JayVii	just dhcpcd
2015-11-29 01:30:37	JayVii	which is enabled by default anyway
2015-11-29 01:31:12	psyq	hehe
2015-11-29 01:31:19	psyq	yeah that is true
2015-11-29 02:04:27	◀▬▬	JayVii (~JayVii@unaffiliated/jayvii) has quit (Quit: JayVii)
2015-12-15 23:23:06	JayVii	nope
2015-12-15 23:23:28	psyq	oohh
2015-12-15 23:24:00	psyq	but you are on void as the primary right
2015-12-15 23:24:16	JayVii	debian :P i've never been much of an arch user. but i'm using void for about a year now
2015-12-15 23:24:31	JayVii	yes, void is and was my primary
2015-12-15 23:24:58	JayVii	and except for my server, all my machines are running voidlinux :)
2015-12-15 23:26:06	JayVii	that's cool! :)
2015-12-15 23:26:44	psyq	I just wanted to see if it is as easy to install bspvm, xmonad, openbox, awesome spectrwm
2015-12-15 23:28:42	JayVii	IMO void is extremely easy to install :)
2015-12-15 23:29:54	psyq	that I it what i think too
2015-12-15 23:30:35	psyq	but I am playing around with a lot of WM's and was just wondering if Void is as easy to install any WM's on as Arch is
2015-12-15 23:31:03	JayVii	sure... why wouldn't it? :P
2015-12-15 23:35:54	psyq	I have no idea hahaha I am just starting playing around with linux seriously now hehehe
2015-12-15 23:36:38	JayVii	:)
2015-12-15 23:45:28	psyq	JayVii do you have any experience with multiple monitors?
2015-12-15 23:45:40	JayVii	a tiny bit
2015-12-15 23:45:56	psyq	okie what do I need to make it work
2015-12-15 23:46:22	JayVii	depends on the WM & GPU-drivers you are using
2015-12-15 23:46:54	JayVii	usually xrandr can handle ll of it, though
2015-12-15 23:47:10	psyq	intel and i3, awesome, openbox
2015-12-15 23:47:53	JayVii	yup. xrandr will be your friend, then :)
2015-12-15 23:48:12	JayVii	failry logical
2015-12-15 23:48:15	psyq	also with xmonad and bspwm
2015-12-15 23:49:23	JayVii	just play around with it :) the command chains can get quite long, so it might be a good idea to write mini-scripts for that or even setup hotkeys
2015-12-15 23:49:52	psyq	okie 
2015-12-15 23:49:59	psyq	thank you for your help
2015-12-15 23:50:13	JayVii	for example, for connecting my 1920x1080 TV to my 1024x600 netbook, i'd do:
2015-12-15 23:50:40	psyq	nice
2015-12-15 23:51:08	JayVii	xrandr --output HDMI0 --mode 1920x1080i --left-of LVDS1 --output LVDS1 --mode 1024x600 --primary
