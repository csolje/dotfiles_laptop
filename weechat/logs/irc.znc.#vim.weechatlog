2016-01-16 15:16:48	DrSlony	[02:57:52] rcyr exactly what I was looking for, great big thanks :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	rcyr	[02:57:58] You're welcome.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	phy1729	[02:58:29] can also do :%/1400/1500/gc  the c is for confirm
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jamessan	[02:58:54] and s is for substitute
2016-01-16 15:16:48	phy1729	[02:59:01] er right
2016-01-16 15:16:48	rcyr	[02:59:47] Ha
2016-01-16 15:16:48	rcyr	[02:59:55] Didn't know about 'c'
2016-01-16 15:16:48	phy1729	[03:02:17] :h :s_flags for the rest

2016-01-16 15:16:48	ezzieyguywuf	[03:48:45] hello: I am trying to use :tags to jump to tags. However, whenever I use the command, vim seems to include the parenthesis and sometimes the argument for the function I'm trying to jump to
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ezzieyguywuf	[03:49:09] for example, if I have my curser on the 'e' in "selectItem(widget)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ezzieyguywuf	[03:49:14] (the first e)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ezzieyguywuf	[03:49:29] and use the "tags" command, I get an error that "SelectItem(widget) not found"
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ezzieyguywuf	[03:49:36] even though selectItem is in my tags file
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ezzieyguywuf	[03:49:41] what am I doing wrong?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Bheru27	[03:55:55] using vim
2016-01-16 15:16:48	amjam	[03:57:08] ezzieyguywuf: what are you trying to do?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	amjam	[03:57:27] go to the definition of SelectItem?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ezzieyguywuf	[03:59:17] amjam: yes
2016-01-16 15:16:48	amjam	[04:15:26] ezzieyguywuf: I think you need to hit Ctrl+] to do that
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ezzieyguywuf	[04:18:16] amjam: I've tried that too
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jerichowasahoax	[04:55:42] any way I can get vim to highlight keywords like TODO in #warn statements, as well as comments?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jerichowasahoax	[04:55:55] sure, i could search for "TODO" and use that to highlight them but that's less than ideal
2016-01-16 15:16:48	eiffi	[05:44:42] k
2016-01-16 15:16:48	eiffi	[05:44:47] oops
2016-01-16 15:16:48	meth	[05:46:46] https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim the default colors and themes are not very good for people with 4 eyes.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	meth	[06:21:33] why vim on windows isn't as friendly as in OSX?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	flappynerd	[06:33:10] meth: because Windows
2016-01-16 15:16:48	flappynerd	[06:33:39] osx ~= linux/bsd
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mehwork	[06:41:45] in iterm2 using gnu screen my arrow keys don't move my cursor in vim, but they don't if i'm not using screen. Any idea why?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mehwork	[06:45:14] i have $TERM set to screen-256color-bce
2016-01-16 15:16:48	flappynerd	[06:59:14] mehwork: I've had that problem before
2016-01-16 15:16:48	flappynerd	[06:59:25] mehwork: I forget what the solution was however
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mehwork	[07:08:31] it seemed to be a temporary thing, restarting screen works
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mehwork	[07:09:31] now if i could just get the block cursorshape to work with it like it does outside of vim
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ggVGc	[07:10:25] "tried turning it off and on again?"
2016-01-16 15:16:48	mehwork	[07:12:10] i want to make this work inside gnu screen: let &t_SI = "\<Esc>]50;CursorShape=1\x7"
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gaol	[08:47:39] hello
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gaol	[08:48:32] i have the dictionary here:
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gaol	[08:48:35] http://www.gaol.org.uk/dictionary.txt
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gaol	[08:49:02] is there a way to just keep words that have 6 letters?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gaol	[08:51:50] not sure if i can do it on notepad++
2016-01-16 15:16:48	sakkemo	[09:04:24] gaol: :v/\w\{6}$/d maybe
2016-01-16 15:16:48	gaol	[09:06:32] sakkemo: ah didn't work sadly, but thank you
2016-01-16 15:16:48	sakkemo	[09:06:58] I'll boot my computer then :P
2016-01-16 15:16:48	sakkemo	[09:08:35] gaol: :v/^\w\{6}$/d :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:29:20] I have a weird problem.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:29:37] I have nobackup, noswapfile, backupcopy=no and nowritebackup set.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:29:48] And for all files it just writes directly to the file as it should.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:29:57] But for *.go files, it first removes the file for some reason.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:30:11] Even if I set the filetype to something other than go.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:30:30] How can I see how Go files are handled?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:31:35] And even if I set the filetype to go for *.anything it will not remove it.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:31:38] Hemmm.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	sakkemo	[09:35:05] ome: you can check where those settings are set from with :verb set nobackup?  etc. (including the ?)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:38:03] It doesn't show anything.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	sakkemo	[09:38:37] for each of those?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	sakkemo	[09:38:55] if it's set up from some file, then it does
2016-01-16 15:16:48	davidosomething	[09:39:04] sounds like a plugin
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:39:28] Yeah, just figured.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:39:38] Looks like go-vim is doing something something.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:40:26] vim-go*
2016-01-16 15:16:48	davidosomething	[09:41:11] is gofmt rewriting on save?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:41:29] Possibly.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:41:33] Let me disable it.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	davidosomething	[09:42:00] let g:go_fmt_autosave = 0
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:42:37] That is it.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:48:25] Well, here is the code to blame https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/blob/master/autoload/go/fmt.vim#L56-L164
2016-01-16 15:16:48	ome	[09:48:30] I know little to no VimL.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Fjorgynn	[10:47:27] hest
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jgt	[11:08:10] festhest
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Caelum	[11:27:21] ugh, filetype always sets my tw, but I don't want this, I only want tw set when I'm in a gitcommit ft
2016-01-16 15:16:48	Caelum	[11:27:29] should I make an autocommand for this?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	⚡	Caelum [11:27:49] doesn't believe in wrapping code
2016-01-16 15:16:48	xterm	[11:39:06] hey that vimcolors.com site looks pretty cool.
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[12:27:51] this is #vim
2016-01-16 15:16:48	nedbat	[12:28:05] correct
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[12:28:22] that was a reponse to some fellow's statement that he made a couple of days ago
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[12:28:35] seems like i had my weechat scrolled all the way to the top for some reason
2016-01-16 15:16:48	nedbat	[12:28:43] scrollback is a bitch sometimes :)
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[12:29:28] i tend to embarrass myself quite often because of the scrollback
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[12:30:08] synthmeat's quit message ounds like one of those quotes from vim-motivate lol
2016-01-16 15:16:48	SylvieLorxu	[12:35:15] Heh, funny to hear about vim-motivate. I was pretty sure there would be other plugins doing exactly the same as mine but with other quotes: https://notabug.org/SylvieLorxu/vim-friendlyremark
2016-01-16 15:16:48	SylvieLorxu	[12:35:48] Oh look at that, it's pure vimscript, that's much cooler
2016-01-16 15:16:48	SylvieLorxu	[12:36:29] Although it looks like vim-motivate will loop infinitely if your screen is very small
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[12:54:18] you wrote SylvieLorxu or ?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[12:54:22] you wrote vim-motivate **
2016-01-16 15:16:48	de-vri-es	[12:54:42] gonna guess vim-friendlyremark
2016-01-16 15:16:48	de-vri-es	[12:55:04] considering the URL just posted :p
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jellytux	[13:26:23] Hi there I am working with jade file, and the script tags involve only coffeescript and the style tags contains only sass
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jellytux	[13:26:25] https://gist.github.com/statianzo/707600#file-jade-vim-L46
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jellytux	[13:26:41] what I am using is .tag riotjs files
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jellytux	[13:27:15] can I make use of the gist to replace script tags to have syntax highlighting for coffeescript instead of javascript and the same for style tags with css<->sass?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jellytux	[13:38:53] https://github.com/jellytux/vim-jade/blob/master/syntax/jade.vim
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jellytux	[13:39:10] so basically he has @htmlJavascript everywhere here
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jellytux	[13:39:29] but where is it defined? Not anywhere lol
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jellytux	[13:40:42] silent! syntax include @htmlCoffeescript syntax/coffee.vim
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jellytux	[13:40:54] one of the top lines
2016-01-16 15:16:48	jellytux	[13:41:01] but how do you enable it?
2016-01-16 15:16:48	bithon	[13:51:35] de-vri-es: yeah that makes more sense. didn't really pay attention to the url
