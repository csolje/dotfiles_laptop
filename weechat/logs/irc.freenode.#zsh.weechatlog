2016-01-07 21:35:55	amcsi	Mikachu, the problem I have is zsh can't recognize my current directory by itself, because I'm using cygwin. That's why I would like a way to specify startup arguments like "cd". If I call zsh at the end of a command, I get the same issue, and I'm just taken to $HOME

2016-01-07 21:36:18	Mikachu	maybe your interactive init files change directory
2016-01-07 21:36:25	Mikachu	you should fix them if that's the case
2016-01-07 21:36:56	amcsi	Mikachu, but it's dynamic which directory I need to chdir into
2016-01-07 21:37:13	amcsi	in PHPStorm it can be passed as a dynamic %d parameter
2016-01-07 21:37:22	Mikachu	the issue is probably that your init files changes to your home directory
2016-01-07 21:37:29	Mikachu	fix that
2016-01-07 21:37:32	Mikachu	and you can be wherever you want

2016-01-07 23:11:07	Mikachu	the answer is yes, it is
2016-01-07 23:11:16	tibbs|w	Whenever the zsh package updates, existing shells start having issues because an important component of $fpath is now missing.
2016-01-07 23:11:31	tibbs|w	I was toying with the idea of getting rid of it or doing some things with symlinks.
2016-01-07 23:11:32	Mikachu	only if you delete files expected by a running program
2016-01-07 23:11:43	Mikachu	the same happens if you uninstall anything else while using it
2016-01-07 23:11:49	phy1729	tibbs|w: they could also break by not supporting what the new scripts use
2016-01-07 23:11:53	tibbs|w	Well, it's not uninstalled; it was updated.
2016-01-07 23:12:17	tibbs|w	Since that directory changes names on even a subminor version bump, it's kind of annoying.
2016-01-07 23:12:41	tibbs|w	Anyway, I think that yes, there's the potential for breakage.  That breakage can't be much worse than not having anything there at all.
2016-01-07 23:12:56	Mikachu	just don't uninstall the old version before you stop using it
2016-01-07 23:13:07	tibbs|w	Distros don't work that way.
2016-01-07 23:13:14	phy1729	homebrew doesn't use the version'd path fwiw
2016-01-07 23:13:16	Mikachu	that isn't zsh's fault
2016-01-07 23:13:18	tibbs|w	You update the package; you get the new stuff.
2016-01-07 23:13:30	tibbs|w	I never said it was zsh's fault, did I?
2016-01-07 23:13:31	phy1729	not saying you should emulate homebrew though
2016-01-07 23:13:47	tibbs|w	I'm merely asking if there's some deeper reason for that versioned directory.
2016-01-07 23:14:14	tibbs|w	Good to know that homebrew doesn't use it.
2016-01-07 23:14:37	tibbs|w	I'll have to see how it gets disabled.
2016-01-07 23:15:49	tibbs|w	I wonder what other distributions do.
2016-01-07 23:15:55	Mikachu	well, if you didn't have a versioned directory, installing different versions would clobber eachother's files
2016-01-07 23:16:07	tibbs|w	We don't install multiple versions at once.
2016-01-07 23:16:15	Mikachu	who is we?
2016-01-07 23:16:18	tibbs|w	Fedora.

2016-01-07 23:16:40	tibbs|w	If you're rolling your own, surely you could put those files wherever you wanted.
2016-01-07 23:19:09	Mikachu	i hope you never look in the lib directory
2016-01-07 23:19:54	Mikachu	it's literally full of versioned files

2016-01-07 23:20:08	tibbs|w	Any shell that has them dlopened will still have access to them regardless of what gets deleted.

2016-01-07 23:20:30	Mikachu	if you happened to dlopen them before you delete running software, yeah
2016-01-07 23:20:43	Mikachu	the same applies to autoloaded functions

2016-01-07 23:35:05	tibbs|w	I have some good arguments, though I wonder what problems exist with the way homebrew does it.
2016-01-07 23:35:21	Mikachu	the versioned directory allows you to update without breaking the running version, (as well as having multiple versions installed at once)
2016-01-07 23:35:32	Mikachu	and ensures you don't accidentally run code for another version
2016-01-07 23:37:04	tibbs|w	Perhaps related, is the stuff in fndir actually that bound to the zsh version?  I would think that with a shell you'd expect quite a high level of cross-version compatibility for minor version bumps.
2016-01-07 23:37:32	m0viefreak	it is
2016-01-07 23:37:41	Mikachu	it would be more likely to not cause problems when downgrading

2016-01-07 23:43:47	m0viefreak	why do you need to deal with it?
2016-01-07 23:44:00	tibbs|w	Because it causes problems for users, who ask about it.
2016-01-07 23:44:00	m0viefreak	isnt it the user's task to restart the thing they were updating?
2016-01-07 23:44:07	tibbs|w	The system updates itself.
2016-01-07 23:44:14	Mikachu	you can have /etc/zshrc zcompile system fpath into users ~/.zsh/foo-version.zwc or so
2016-01-07 23:44:24	Mikachu	if you put that file first in fpath, the actual system fpath dirs will never be examined
2016-01-07 23:44:33	tibbs|w	Hmm.
2016-01-07 23:44:45	Mikachu	that will leave a bunch of old files in ~/.zsh eventually though

2016-01-07 23:46:38	tibbs|w	Indeed, except that's not generally the kind of thing a package manager would do.
2016-01-07 23:46:40	m0viefreak	the running shells will be fine until they need something from pfath that hasnt been autoloaded yet

2016-01-07 23:47:51	m0viefreak	it is
2016-01-07 23:48:06	m0viefreak	everything thats loaded doesnt rely on external files anymore
2016-01-07 23:48:41	tibbs|w	Is that recent?  I'll have to downgrade to 5.1.1 and then update to 5.2 again and catalog exactly what breaks.
2016-01-07 23:49:20	m0viefreak	no

2016-01-07 23:49:53	tibbs|w	Ah, that must be it.
2016-01-07 23:50:09	m0viefreak	and in that case you will get error messages, and the user will known that they need to restart the shell
2016-01-07 23:50:14	Mikachu	you can of course also just change $fpath in your running shell if you want
2016-01-07 23:50:39	tibbs|w	True.  But then just running exec is shorter.
2016-01-07 23:50:40	Mikachu	(i don't suggest this) ;)
2016-01-07 23:50:54	tibbs|w	Unless you have state you can't handle losing.
2016-01-07 23:51:26	llua	updating zsh at that moment prob wasn't a good idea then
2016-01-07 23:51:57	tibbs|w	That's all true, though sometimes it's not something over which you have control.
2016-01-07 23:52:11	tibbs|w	Sure, you could not have automatic updates.
2016-01-07 23:52:33	Mikachu	you can do the windows way, and popup a window saying "okay, we're going to reboot now, fuck you"
2016-01-07 23:52:36	tibbs|w	Would be kind of nice if more programs could tell you that they need to be restarted.
2016-01-07 23:52:39	phy1729	I thought the kernel does something special to not delete the files for a while
2016-01-07 23:52:50	tibbs|w	phy1729: Yeah, the kernel is magical.
2016-01-07 23:52:50	Mikachu	phy1729: it does if they're open
2016-01-07 23:52:59	Mikachu	the entire point of autoload is that we _don't_ open the files though
2016-01-07 23:53:09	phy1729	well rpm does something special with the kernel package
2016-01-07 23:53:18	tibbs|w	Yeah, I thought that's what you meant.
2016-01-07 23:53:32	tibbs|w	kernel packages have no conflicting files, so you can install several.
2016-01-07 23:53:35	Mikachu	cat $^fpath/*(N.) > /dev/null  0.01s user 0.05s system 1% cpu 4.427 total
2016-01-07 23:53:50	Mikachu	that would be a painful cost at startup
2016-01-07 23:54:19	tibbs|w	Yeah, autoloads are still a good thing even in this age of huge RAM and SSDs.
2016-01-07 23:54:20	phy1729	tibbs|w: could split fpath stuff into a subpackage so the subpackages don't conflict
2016-01-07 23:54:55	tibbs|w	That's kind of a possibility, but then the behavior of the kernel package is actually used only for the kernel package.

2016-01-08 00:07:19	Mikachu	does it work if you call your hook from that hook too?
2016-01-08 00:07:50	m0viefreak	yeah, kinda.

2016-01-08 00:08:51	m0viefreak	i was just wondering why it doesnt call pre-redraw, too
2016-01-08 00:08:57	m0viefreak	since the BUFFER is actually changing
2016-01-08 00:09:15	Mikachu	well, the code doesn't care if buffer changes, it cares if zle_redraw() gets called
2016-01-08 00:09:21	Mikachu	more or less
2016-01-08 00:09:38	Mikachu	i guess i can just add the hook call where isearch hook is called

2016-01-08 00:10:06	Mikachu	ah yes, i moved the pre hook to the zle input loop
2016-01-08 00:10:11	Mikachu	which presumably isn't called from minibuffers
2016-01-08 00:10:18	m0viefreak	ah
2016-01-08 00:10:31	Mikachu	calling it from inside redraw() was overly excessive

2016-01-08 00:11:22	m0viefreak	i guess for zsh-syntax-highlighting the best approach would then be a combinatino of pre-redraw and a manual wrapping of isearch-update
2016-01-08 00:11:33	m0viefreak	i wish there was a add-zsh-hook for those zle-* widgets, too
2016-01-08 00:12:17	Mikachu	i don't use those, so that's probably why :P

2016-01-13 20:57:35	danielsh	tailgate, a hashed command name (i.e., something from $PATH), a function name, etc

2016-01-13 23:21:39	tibbs|w	True.  I'm just used to the old days where you actually used /bin/[ and didn't think of (( )) as a "command" in that context.
2016-01-13 23:22:00	Mikachu	certainly anything you can put && after, you can use as an if condition

2016-01-15 22:30:03	Mikachu	isn't special for example, when you're just doing a string pattern match
