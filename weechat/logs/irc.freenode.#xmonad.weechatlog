2015-12-19 17:05:13	geekosaur	enough people disagree that I lifted that from someone else's config
2015-12-19 17:05:40	vrs	I think they disagree because dynamiclog was buggy ootb until a few weeks ago

2015-12-19 17:07:07	vrs	hm come to think of it I'm not 100% sure if that "get screens" bug whose fix entered master a while ago was related to this

2015-12-19 17:07:48	TTimo	huuuuu
2015-12-19 17:08:05	TTimo	ah ok
2015-12-19 17:08:13	vrs	personally I like to have desktop specific outputs as an indicator of which screen my focus is on
2015-12-19 17:08:14	TTimo	clearly I misunderstood then
2015-12-19 17:08:26	geekosaur	this is not a question of getting screens, it is someone wants the same log information in both, not the log information for that screen (which is dubiously meaningful for anything beyond window title)
2015-12-19 17:08:48	vrs	I color only the focused screen's bar
2015-12-19 17:08:49	TTimo	how would I manage two instances of xmobar running, and having them draw on the right desktop ?
2015-12-19 17:08:55	vrs	the nonfocused ones are greyed out
2015-12-19 17:09:11	vrs	that is why I want scren specific output
2015-12-19 17:09:42	vrs	TTimo: dynamicbars, but beware, it's a bit sparse on documentation
2015-12-19 17:12:25	geekosaur	also I think you need to explain what you are trying to accomplish
2015-12-19 17:12:40	vrs	geekosaur: right, that bugfix was only about dynamic update after screen layout change
2015-12-19 17:18:25	TTimo	geekosaur: ah that's a nice trick with bash there :)
2015-12-19 17:18:29	TTimo	well tee, mostly
2015-12-19 17:18:54	geekosaur	the >(..) thing is bash and zsh only
2015-12-19 17:19:10	TTimo	interesting
2015-12-19 17:19:41	TTimo	is there a more haskellish way? using spawnPipe twice ?
2015-12-19 17:19:53	TTimo	not that I really need it, this will work fine
2015-12-19 17:20:05	geekosaur	you would have to spawnPipe twice and write to both in ppOutput, yes
2015-12-19 17:20:42	TTimo	that should be reasonably easy to write

2016-01-12 22:45:24	medfly	it's Octave 4.0.0 or so

2016-01-12 23:32:30	medfly	even trying to focus on another window and moving between workspaces?
2016-01-12 23:32:37	medfly	it always focuses the octave workspace

2016-01-12 23:35:31	Bonkers	I'm using Layout.PerWorkspace to set the layout of a particular workspace to be only one choice of tabbed from Layout.Tabbed, everything works in general, but when I reload my config after changing the theme, it doesn't get picked up. if I temporarily switch the config to something that is not tabbed, reload, then set back to tabbed, and reload, the theme works fine. how do I fix this?
2016-01-12 23:37:52	Bonkers	it seems that until something triggers the layout to change, the config never gets reloaded

2016-01-13 22:42:55	uncle-j_j	it's always starts as float window
2016-01-13 22:43:06	uncle-j_j	p.s. i use gimp as single window
2016-01-13 22:44:22	geekosaur	generally you need to replace the default manageHook
2016-01-13 22:44:40	geekosaur	(or upgrade to 0.12 or git, where we dropped that default because it's obsolete)

2016-01-13 23:48:45	geekosaur	yes. that is because you are not also removing line 93 of that oh so wonderful config that does what you are not supposed to do
2016-01-13 23:49:14	geekosaur	(namely copy the so called default that works by hardcoding defaults so that you get in trouble when the next xmonad version changes those defaults)
2016-01-13 23:49:59	geekosaur	but since you have that youu must get rid of the stuff on line 93 or it will undo your float. but if you get rid of that then it won't be floated anyway so you don't need to add anything

2016-01-15 23:09:32	jdoe	I would prefer them to be mostly independent... right now it's just using dzenPP, but ideally each screen would have its own "this is my active workspace", show the current focused window title per screen, and I guess share a tray (separate problem)

2016-01-15 23:19:35	fizzie	I've done that with a separate dzen2-runner program (which gets updates from XMonad via DBus), but it's not really something polished for others to use.
2016-01-15 23:23:17	fizzie	The existing DynamicLog machinery isn't of much use if you want per-screen things like that, but of course it's possible to just have a custom logHook that collects those things and writes them to bars you've spawnPipe'd.
2016-01-15 23:24:20	fizzie	(A shared tray with the same icons appearing on each screen might be a bit too much to ask for.)
